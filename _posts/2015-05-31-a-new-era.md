Alright! I just got my blog going on github using github pages. Super cool. Thanks github!

Here is a sample of my uber coding skills. Let's get functional! 
####<span class="red">Warning: The following code is not functional.</span>

{% highlight python %}
#import the system module
import sys

#get file name from passed args
filename=sys.argv[1]

#open file for reading, use binary mode
fd=open(filename, 'rb')

#print each line in the file
for line in fd.readlines():
    print line
{% endhighlight %}
