Even commercial firms that fully comply with industry “best practice” cyber security standards cannot cope with military-style cyber-attacks. We posit that the primary reason is the increasing asymmetry between the cyber-offensive capability of attackers and the cyber-defensive capability of commercial organisations. A key avenue to resolve this asymmetry is for organisations to leverage cyber-threat intelligence (CTI) to direct their cyber-defence. How can commercial organisations adopt and integrate CTI to routinely defend their information systems and resources from increasingly advanced cyber- attacks? There is limited know-how on how to package CTI to inform the practices of enter- prise-wide stakeholders. This clinical research describes a practitioner-researcher’s experiences in directing a large multinational finance corporation to adopt and integrate CTI to transform cybersecurity-related practice and behaviour. The research contributes practical know-how on the organisational adoption and integration of CTI, enacted through the transformation of cybersecurity practice, and enterprise-wide implementation of a novel solution to package CTI for commercial contexts. The study illustrates the inputs, processes, and outputs in clinical research as a genre of action research.</p><p class="s8" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;">ARTICLE HISTORY</p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;">Received 14 September 2020</p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;">Accepted 7 June 2022</p><p class="s8" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;">KEYWORDS</p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Cybersecurity; information security management; cyber defence; incident response; threat intelligence; clinical information systems practice</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ol id="l1"><li data-list-text="1."><h2 style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark3">&zwnj;</a>Introduction</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark72" style=" color: black; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 10.5pt;" name="bookmark4">Cybersecurity is a critical concern for organisations globally. Cyber-attackers target organisational infor- mation and systems resources for financial gain or geo-political imperatives. This includes theft of sensi- tive customer data, intellectual property, confidential plans relating to business strategy, and disruption of mission-critical IT systems. The cyber-threat land- scape has shifted in recent years with the emergence of organised crime syndicates and nation-state para- military cyber entities. Terminology such as advanced persistent threats (APTs) are now used to describe such entities (Ahmad et al., </a>2019<a href="#bookmark91" style=" color: black; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 10.5pt;">; Lemay et al., </a>2018<span style=" color: #000;">). APTs are increasingly sophisticated, recruiting IT experts into purpose-built teams and deploying mili- tary-grade cyber weaponry in high-precision attacks against selected targets.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">In contrast, organisational cyber-defences have not evolved at the same rate. Many commercial organisa- tions have institutionalised complex cybersecurity structures to comply with obligations imposed by law, regulation, general “best practice” industry frame- works and standards. Consequently, organisations find themselves in an asymmetrical arms-race against cyber-threat actors that are so agile and aggressive that</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">they can bypass or overwhelm even the most sophis- ticated cyber defences. High-value organisations have to defend against a massive volume of cyber-attacks on a daily basis. The same principles that have established organisations’ asymmetry vis-a-vis cyber attackers may also hold the answer to resolving it. This would imply that commercial organisations adopt military- inspired principles to defend themselves, given the nature of the emerging cyber threat landscape.</p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark83" style=" color: black; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 10.5pt;" name="bookmark5">Military organisations have long understood the invaluable role that threat intelligence plays in direct- ing operations against hostile actors. In similar vein, we argue that cyber-threat intelligence has a critical role to play in redressing the asymmetrical advantage to cyber-attackers over cyber-defenders. Cyber threat intelligence (CTI) is the process of “acquiring, proces- sing, analyzing, and disseminating information that identifies, tracks, and predicts threats, risks, and opportunities inside the cyber domain to offer courses of action that enhance decision making” (Ettinger, </a>2019<a href="#bookmark101" style=" color: black; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 10.5pt;">). CTI thus has the potential to change organisa- tions’ cybersecurity behaviour from being reactive to “proactive, anticipatory and dynamic” (Shin &amp; Lowry, </a>2020<span style=" color: #000;">, p. 6). CTI can play a critical role in directing organisational behaviour in prevention, detection and response to cyber-attacks. For example, CTI can</span><a name="bookmark6">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark7">&zwnj;</a>CONTACT <a href="mailto:atif@unimelb.edu.au" style=" color: black; font-family:Arial, sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 8pt;" target="_blank">Atif Ahmad  </a><span class="s14">atif@unimelb.edu.au  </span><span class="s10">School of Computing &amp; Information Systems, Faculty of Engineering and IT, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria, Australia</span></p><p class="s15" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">© 2022 The Author(s).

CTI can assist in detection of cyber-attacks by tasking intrusion detection systems to patterns of exploitation related to specific threat actors. And, CTI can direct cyber-response by providing a precise defence strategy to combat a cyber-threat actor’s modus operandi (Shin &amp; Lowry, </a>2020 <a href="#bookmark83" style=" color: black; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 10.5pt;">p. 1; Ettinger, </a>2019<span style=" color: #000;">). Therefore, organisations’ ability to assimilate and  operationalise  cyber  threat  intelligence  on a routine basis is central in this regard.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">For commercial organisations, the adoption of CTI poses several challenges. The military mindset asso- ciated with the use of threat intelligence is foreign to the typical business culture that prevails in many of these  organisations. Given  the emerging cyber- militarised threat environment, there is limited know- how about the deployment and routinisation of CTI to inform actions of executives and business managers. Moreover, many of these organisations would need to transform  their  cybersecurity  practice  from a predominantly compliance-driven and reactive logic towards a proactive logic driven by CTI.</p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark65" style=" color: black; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 10.5pt;" name="bookmark8">How can commercial organisations adopt and inte- grate cyber threat intelligence to transform their cyber defence behaviour from being reactive and undirected to being proactive and directed? The paper describes how a practitioner-researcher addressed this clinical problem in a large multinational corporation that transformed their cybersecurity practice towards a CTI-driven approach</a><span style=" color: #00007F; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 7pt; vertical-align: 3pt;">1</span><a href="#bookmark89" style=" color: black; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 10.5pt;">.

The clinical research reported in this paper draws on the practitioner-researcher’s practical experience in cyber- security management and on his research expertise developed  in  partnership  with  researcher- practitioners (in this case Information Systems and Cybersecurity scholars; cf., Iversen et al., </a>2004<a href="#bookmark100" style=" color: black; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 10.5pt;">; Schön, </a>1983<span style=" color: #000;">).</span><a name="bookmark9">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">The paper is structured as follows. To situate the clinical research, we review literature pertinent to the emerging cybersecurity threat landscape and the use of CTI in organisations. We then describe the research approach followed by the practitioner-researcher in two phases. In phase 1, the case organisation adopted CTI as innovation in its IT Operations Division. In phase 2 the innovation is translated into a novel solu- tion – CTI-as-a-service – as a means to package and integrate CTI into the broader commercial context and for business users. We describe the enterprise- wide integration of CTI-as-a-service, including con- comitant interventions to influence managerial beha- viour and risk calculus.

An Advanced Persistent Threat is defined as an “entity that engages in a malicious, organized, and highly sophisticated long-term or reit- erated network intrusion and exploitation operation to obtain information from a target organization, sabotage its operations, or both” (Ahmad et al., </a>2019<span style=" color: #000;">, p. 406).</span><a name="bookmark12">&zwnj;</a><a name="bookmark13">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: justify;">The underlying reason for this disparity is that the</p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark101" style=" color: black; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 10.5pt;" name="bookmark14">increasing sophistication and militarisation of the cyber  threat  landscape  has  not  been  met  by a commensurate re-orientation of cyber defence in private enterprise (Shin &amp; Lowry, </a>2020<a href="#bookmark72" style=" color: black; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 10.5pt;">). APTs invest their time and resources studying the cyber defences of their targets and experimenting with novel ways to penetrate and acquire their mission objectives (e.g., theft of IP and/or disruption of IT services; Ahmad et al., </a>2019<span style=" color: #000;">). In contrast, private enterprise has long adopted an inward perspective aimed at complying with general industry cybersecurity standards while remaining largely oblivious to the activities of cyber- threat actors. Consequently, while many commercial organisations invest in high levels of general cyber- readiness, they lack sufficient </span><span class="s20">situation awareness </span><a href="#bookmark73" style=" color: black; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 10.5pt;">of the threat landscape and adversaries to develop the required defensive capabilities (Ahmad et al., </a>2021<span style=" color: #000;">).</span></p><p class="s18" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark77" style=" color: black; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 10.5pt;" name="bookmark15">As Baskerville (</a>2005<a href="#bookmark77" style=" color: black; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 10.5pt;">) pointed out almost two dec- ades ago, the prevailing prevention paradigm assumes risks can be anticipated, measured, and quantifiably mitigated in advance using cybersecurity controls. This paradigm renders risk management a problem of compliance, rooted in the probabilities of known attacks. Instead, Baskerville (</a>2005<a href="#bookmark85" style=" color: black; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 10.5pt;">) advocates for pos- sibilistic thinking in cyber defence. Indeed, this mode of thinking is applicable, given developments in the cybersecurity threat landscape in recent times. In par- ticular, the possibilistic paradigm seems more appro- priate in the light of novel and innovative means of attack. Such cyber-attacks are dynamic and their risks cannot be quantified in advance. Thus, organisations have to turn to threat intelligence as a means of responding to highly unpredictable and insidious cyber threats. This is in line with Sun Tzu’s famous metaphor in his Art of War (Giles, </a>1910<span style=" color: #000;">): </span><span class="s20">“If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles.

They further explain the fine dis- tinction between general readiness and readiness to defend against specific adversaries as follows: <i>“ . . . imagine that a boxer trains to improve his/her defenses in advance of a match. First, the boxer can try to improve his/her general defense skills without regard to the upcoming opponent. Second, the boxer can also train in a manner tailored to the opponent’s offensive style. A boxer can thus increase his/her odds of success by mastering both general defense and defense tailored to an opponent’s unique offensive strengths” </i>(p. 3).</p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: justify;">A more detailed definition of CTI is “ . . . contex-</p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark75" style=" color: black; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 10.5pt;" name="bookmark17">tualized output of a strategically-driven process of collection and analysis of information pertaining to the identities, goals, motivations, tools and tactics of malicious entities intending to harm or undermine a targeted organization’s operations, ICT systems or the information flowing through them” (Bank of England, </a>2016<a href="#bookmark87" style=" color: black; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 10.5pt;">, p. 12). CTI thus encompasses evi- dence-based knowledge that can include context, mechanisms, indicators, implications and/or advice (Holland, </a>2015<a href="#bookmark95" style=" color: black; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 10.5pt;">; Samtani et al., </a>2020<a href="#bookmark99" style=" color: black; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 10.5pt;">; Schlette et al., </a>2021<span style=" color: #000;">). In most cases CTI is aimed at cybersecurity professionals as it enables them to proactively defend against attack, reactively detect and diagnose a breach and prioritise incidents based on risk exposure.</span><a name="bookmark18">&zwnj;</a></p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark101" style=" color: black; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 10.5pt;" name="bookmark19">CTI enables cybersecurity professionals to develop situation awareness of the incident environment and the “attack surface” (the sum of all vectors of attack to penetrate an organisation; Shin &amp; Lowry, </a>2020<a href="#bookmark88" style=" color: black; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 10.5pt;">). CTI is also a key enabler for cyber defence, for example, tracking and breaking the attacker’s kill-chain (recon- naissance,  weaponisation,  delivery,  exploitation, installation, command &amp; control, actions on objective; Hutchins et al., </a>2011<span style=" color: #000;">). However, CTI is also critical for general managerial and executive stakeholders as it helps them to understand their risk exposure and the options they have to mitigate potential impacts.</span></p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark90" style=" color: black; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 10.5pt;" name="bookmark20">In organisational contexts, CTI functions have the responsibility to identify an organisation’s intelligence requirements, collect relevant information from a range of internal and external sources and develop insights that can be used to inform action and decision-making. This involves synthesising external and organisation- specific sources to produce tailored intelligence that can be disseminated to specific internal users (Lawson et al., </a>2019<a href="#bookmark104" style=" color: black; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 10.5pt;">; Webb et al., </a>2014<span style=" color: #000;">).

Quality of CTI can be measured against nine criteria, mirroring the qual- ity indicators of the US Army’s keystone manual for military intelligence (FM 2–0, </a>2010<span style=" color: #000;">, pp. 1–17):</span></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">(1)  <i>Accurate  </i>(presents  objective  reality),  (2) <i>Relevant </i>(supports the decision-makers conceptua- lisation of the problem) (3) <i>Complete </i>(contains essential  components  required  for  decision- making), (4) <i>Precise </i>(provides the level of detail and complexity required for decision-making), (5) <i>Timely </i>(is presented as early as possible for deci- sion-making), (6) <i>Usable </i>(is easily understood and meaningful to the decision-maker), (7) <i>Reliable </i>(presents  trustworthy  content),  (8)  <i>Predictive </i>(anticipates future events significant to decision- maker) and (9) <i>Tailored </i>(supports and satisfies decision-maker priorities).</p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark95" style=" color: black; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 10.5pt;" name="bookmark24">Despite the existence and utility of vendor-supplied CTI services and general industry guidelines on best practice in cybersecurity, there is very little practical guidance in the literature on how organisations can adopt and integrate CTI. The literature on CTI adop- tion focuses on the technical aspects of CTI such as event aggregation and correlation, machine-based AI techniques for real-time threat hunting as well as post- incident forensic analysis of malware and intrusions (Samtani et al., </a>2020<span style=" color: #000;">). It remains unclear how CTI can be incorporated into routine organisational practices to direct cybersecurity defence against APTs. More broadly, the literature is largely silent on how com- mercial organisations’ culture and processes can be re- oriented to a level of military-style “readiness” to address sophisticated cyber-attacks.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li data-list-text="3."><h2 style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark25">&zwnj;</a>Clinical case: adopting and integrating CTI at greenback financial</h2><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">Greenback Financial (pseudonym) is a large multina- tional finance corporation with a market capitalisation of over fifty billion US dollars, operating in 34 coun- tries spanning North and South America, Central and Southern Asia, Europe, and Oceania.

As depicted in </a><a href="#bookmark53" class="s11">Figure </a>1<a href="#bookmark60" style=" color: black; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 10.5pt;">, the clinical research processes in this study were underpinned by four key inputs. First, the practitioner-researcher not only understands, but is deeply immersed in the clinical context (as an insider, not as outsider). Second, the practi- tioner draws on extensive lived personal experi- ence (several years responsible for cyber defence strategy, and being on the frontline response to numerous cyber-attacks). Third, the practitioner draws on professional and industry practice (pro- fessional  networks  in  the  banking  sector  and information  security  industry).  Fourth,  the research  is  framed  by  practitioner-researcher’s theoretical  knowledge  (of  information  security, adoption and implementation of innovations in organisations,   socio-technical   change,   and research methodology). Wearing the hats of prac- titioner and researcher at the same time and lever- aging both practical and theoretical perspectives on the research problem was instrumental to pro- gress. Combined, these inputs informed the clin- ical action research processes: problem realisation &amp; exploration, solution development &amp; implemen- tation, and reflection &amp; evaluation. In turn, the inputs map onto the key outputs of the clinical research processes: CTI-as-service as the clinical solution (</a><a href="#bookmark60" class="s11">Table </a>1<span style=" color: #000;">) and its impact on the organisa- tion  (refer Appendix),  new  personal  experience gained by the practitioner, contribution to profes- sional industry practice (as articulated in this pub- lication),  and  a  contribution  to  theory  (refer Discussion).</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark53">&zwnj;</a>Figure 1. <span class="s21">Clinical research processes and framework in this study.</span></h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li data-list-text="3.2."><h3 style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: -22pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark27">&zwnj;</a>Phase 1: CTI Adoption in the IT operations division</h3><ol id="l3"><li data-list-text="3.2.1."><h3 style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: -29pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark28">&zwnj;</a>Problem realisation</h3><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">Greenback Financial’s market positioning, iconic sta- tus in their base region, management of large funds transfers, and status as a national-level critical infra- structure organisation makes it a high-value target for APTs. Nation-state backed APTs are interested in disrupting national commerce and reducing trust in national financial systems. As a result of being in the cross-hairs of numerous cyber threat actors, the volume, sophistication, and level of aggression of cyber-attacks experienced by Greenback has dramati- cally increased year-to-year.</p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark79" style=" color: black; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 10.5pt;" name="bookmark54">Reflecting on the emerging cyber threat landscape, the practitioner-researcher came to the following cri- tical realisations. First, in the absence of appropriate interventions,  the  unprecedented  and  escalating volume and sophistication of cyber-attacks will even- tually overcome Greenback Financial’s defences. Second, militarisation of the cyber threat landscape has created a new adversarial reality that has rendered obsolete the traditional model of compliance to con- ventional industry security standards. Hence a new model of cyber defence was needed: military-style cyber-attacks demand a military-style response. The ability to adopt CTI in routine operations was instru- mental in this regard. Third, commercial institutions such as Greenback are not accustomed to operating with this military mindset. Greenback’s managers are more focused on their customers, financial competi- tors and regulators rather than cyber-adversaries. Hence, the adoption of CTI as part of a new model of cyber defence would require concomitant interven- tions to integrate and routinise CTI into the broader organisational culture, changed managerial beha- viours and enterprise-wide processes to respond to this new adversarial reality (Bostrom et al., </a>2009<a href="#bookmark94" style=" color: black; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 10.5pt;">; Mumford, </a>2006<span style=" color: #000;">).</span><a name="bookmark55">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li data-list-text="3.2.2."><h3 style="padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: -29pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark29">&zwnj;</a>Problem exploration</h3><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">To prevent cybersecurity attacks from impacting the firm, Greenback Financial has a sophisticated multi- layered system of defences consisting of best-of-breed firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and anti-virus software augmented with specialised tools from mar- ket  leading  vendors  (e.g.,  FireEye,  Microsoft, Symantec). Greenback invests considerable resources into testing and refining the cyber defensive layers with bespoke code to ensure effectiveness against a broad spectrum of cyber-attacks.</p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark53" style=" color: black; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 10.5pt;">For cyber monitoring and response, Greenback Financial retains a 24 × 7 security operations centre (SOC) that detects, diagnoses and investigates cyber- attacks and coordinates responses with technology operations teams (refer </a><a href="#bookmark53" class="s11">Figure </a>1<span style=" color: #000;">). Greenback’s SOC</span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">consists of three levels of security analysts that work around the clock in shifts. Level 1 analysts triage incidents, collect raw data from individual IT systems to build context which they record in a ticket manage- ment system, analyse the incident to assess criticality, and either coordinate responses or escalate to more experienced analysts depending on the criticality of the incident. Level 2 analysts are more experienced personnel that assist with load management and pro- vide more expert advice (e.g., on false positives). Level 3 analysts acquire situation awareness of global IT operations through the use of specialised analytics tools and engage in diagnosis, investigation and coor- dination of high criticality incidents that may involve coordinating a large-scale response with technology operations teams.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">The practitioner-researcher observed that although the SOC was expertly detecting, diagnosing and coor- dinating the management of incidents, the firm’s response to cyber incidents was reactive, inward- looking and short sighted (i.e., Greenback Financial was unable to identify risks in the immediate future by extrapolating from previous cyber-related events). Further, the firm’s cybersecurity response to attacks was insular in the sense that it was not building on knowledge and insights from other firms that had experienced similar attacks. Cybersecurity operations was able to explain “what” incidents were taking place on the IT infrastructure or “how” cyber-attacks had occurred, but was less able to answer strategic-level questions such as “why” they might be occurring or “who” might be attacking the firm and “when” they might attack next.</p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: justify;">The  practitioner-researcher  concluded  that</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">Greenback Financial must respond proactively to cyber-attacks from sophisticated threat actors and adapt its prevention and response capability to the demands of an evolving threat landscape. In order to do this, a CTI function must be created and fully incorporated with existing cybersecurity operations.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li data-list-text="3.2.3."><h3 style="padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: -29pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark30">&zwnj;</a>CTI as innovation within the IT operations division</h3><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">Greenback Financial retains a vast heterogenous technol- ogy estate spanning thirty-four countries situated in North and South America, Central and Southern Asia, Europe, and Oceania. To prevent and respond to cyber- attacks against the infrastructure, the firm’s SOC relies very heavily on system activity logs generated by the firm’s IT networks and devices. As the number of cyber- related log entries generated every 24 hours reaches approximately 20 billion, the firm uses a security incident and event management (SIEM) system to store, cross- correlate and analyse log entries to identify meaningful attack patterns. A separate custom platform (Advanced Cyber Analytics) collects behavioural monitoring data related to the activities of the firm’s sixty thousand staff.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark56" style=" color: black; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 10.5pt;">As depicted in </a><a href="#bookmark56" class="s11">Figure </a>2<span style=" color: #000;">, the system activity logs are correlated and aggregated (arrows 1 and 2) before secur- ity alerts are generated by real-time algorithms (arrows 3 and 4). Level 1 analysts triage security alerts and deter- mine priority after which high priority incidents are escalated (arrow 5 or 6) while low priority incidents are contained, eradicated and resolved. High severity inci- dents trigger the formation of a Security Leadership Team (Security LT) (arrow 7) that assesses the situation, opens communication channels to relevant stakeholders up the chain of command (arrow 11) and across the breadth of the enterprise (arrow 12). The Security LT coordinates the broad enterprise response with the sup- port of technology and business teams.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">To adopt CTI the firm created a centralised team of 4–6 specially-trained personnel that collects multi- source intelligence from national and international security and law enforcement agencies, threat intelli- gence vendors such as FireEye, and a closed commu- nity of intelligence specialists within the financial sector. The team monitors the threat landscape, col- lects and analyzes threat intelligence from the above- mentioned sources and applies adversarial thinking and frameworks (e.g., the “kill-chain” process of cyber-attacks). This enables the team to provide accu- rate, timely and targeted advice in the form of action- able and organisation-specific insights to security analysts in the SOC as well as the enterprise cyberse- curity leadership team. Further, the firm’s SOC pro- cured  specialised  tools  with  embedded  threat intelligence (e.g., indicators of compromise) to map threat patterns and prioritise which detection and responses require the most attention.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">The threat intelligence team provides operational, tactical and strategic level threat intelligence through reliable and routine feeds (e.g., general alerts, bulle- tins) to relevant stakeholders. At an operational level, the team proactively monitors the threat landscape feeding actionable intelligence to SOC analysts (e.g., blocking IP addresses, interpreting security alerts, sug- gesting possible avenues of investigation) (arrow 8). At a tactical level the team predicts threat activity and validates that against the observations of the Level 3 SOC analysts (arrow 9). At a strategic-level, the team identifies new threat actors and their tactics, techni- ques and procedures (TTPs) to identify and address gaps in the firm’s cyber defences that might be exposed (arrow 10).</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">Outside of the cybersecurity function, CTI was deemed to be critical to a range of executive, manage- rial and operational stakeholders in the broader enter- prise.  Therefore,  CTI  was  supplied  to  these stakeholders to ensure relevant feeds, advisories and bulletins produced by CTI analysts, penetration tes- ters, incident responders as well as specialised CTI software  was  distributed  for  decision-support purposes.</p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark108" style=" color: black; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 10.5pt;">The practitioner-researcher observed that CTI adoption within IT Operations had significantly improved the cybersecurity posture by: (1) improving alignment between the activities of cyber-defence and cyber-attack, (2) reducing the success rate (and there- fore impact) of cyber-attacks as the firm halts attack operations earlier rather than later, and (3) improving efficiency and focus of cyber defence operations against cyber-attacks (Refer Appendix, </a><a href="#bookmark108" class="s11">Table </a>A1<span style=" color: #000;">).</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark56">&zwnj;</a>Figure 2. <span class="s21">Adoption of CTI in the cybersecurity function of greenback financial.</span></h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li></ol></li><li data-list-text="3.3."><h3 style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: -22pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark31">&zwnj;</a>Phase 2: enterprise-wide CTI integration</h3><ol id="l4"><li data-list-text="3.3.1."><h3 style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: -29pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark32">&zwnj;</a>Problem realisation</h3><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">Although CTI was successfully adopted, the practi- tioner-researcher realised that the transformation of cyber security practice was largely localised in the IT Operations unit. The cybersecurity behaviour of sta- keholders across the rest of enterprise, particularly business unit managers, remained largely unaffected.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">For instance, given that IT systems tend to have or  develop  vulnerabilities,  business  owners  are expected to “patch” systems with the latest vendor- issued security updates. A culture of compliance holds that the higher the percentage of patches applied to vulnerable systems, the more compliant the systems are. In this context, compliance is con- sidered to be synonymous with the level of cyber- security. The practitioner-researcher observed a risk calculus is undertaken by asset owners in balancing the competing priorities to maintain high levels of asset uptime on the one hand and vulnerability management on the other. Vulnerability manage- ment requires systems to be taken down to apply patches which reduces uptime. Asset owners are under no obligation to resolve a vulnerability or act on threat intelligence, but instead are only expected to <i>consider </i>thresholds of acceptable risk. The practitioner-researcher observed the tendency of asset owners to simply accept the cybersecurity risk rather than allow the asset to be taken down for patching purposes. As a result, the number of fully patched systems across Greenback Financial fell to less than 40% (i.e., a randomly directed attack at an IT asset was more likely than not to hit a non-compliant system).</p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: justify;">The practitioner-researcher also noted that when</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">provided with specific threat intelligence of attack, some owners were more likely to instal patches on vulnerable IT systems. Although this was promising, large-scale acceptance of CTI across global operations still presented a challenge. The practitioner-researcher observed from experience that CTI is only useful in environments that accept the need for it and under- stand how to leverage it. The challenge of getting stakeholders in Greenback Financial to use CTI was twofold. CTI relates to adversaries that are resourceful (e.g., nation-state backed APTs, organised criminals) and simultaneously invisible. As a result, stakeholders perceive threat intelligence to be of a largely specula- tive nature that is often unable to provide attribution to an attack. Hence when faced with a choice between acting on a speculative piece of intelligence that will incur a cost (reduction of uptime) or not acting on the threat intelligence (i.e., preserving the bottom line), most stakeholders chose the latter. This situation was further exacerbated when threat intelligence appears to be sounding a false alarm. Cybersecurity operations</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">personnel were then perceived to be “crying wolf” which resulted in the erosion of trust between business and IT parties.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">If Greenback Financial were to develop cybersecur- ity risk management practices to enable it to survive in the new hostile environment, then stakeholders would have to fully commit to operationalising CTI into routine processes. The deeply embedded compliance culture presented a challenge to the acceptance of CTI as an essential element of business operations in the cyber-militarised era. The practitioner-researcher recognised that although CTI had been successfully adopted in its IT Operations Division, CTI had to be fully integrated into enterprise-wide processes in order to transform the firm’s cyber defence behaviour.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li data-list-text="3.3.2."><h3 style="padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: -29pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark33">&zwnj;</a>Internal survey: enterprise CTI requirements and business culture</h3><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">The practitioner-researcher commissioned an internal survey. The purpose of the survey was firstly to expand on particular needs relating to CTI driven solutions and secondly, to assess the magnitude of the challenge related to the integration of CTI across the enterprise. Thus a survey instrument was designed to (1) identify CTI needs across different areas of the enterprise, (2) assess the applicability of CTI to various roles (execu- tives, business managers, operational managers) and the extent to which these stakeholders were confident in the utility of CTI in their routine activities, (3) measure the extent to which stakeholders cared about particular cybersecurity outcomes, and (4) assess the level of satisfaction with the existing CTI and the value it provided to them.</p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark89" style=" color: black; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 10.5pt;">The survey instrument was administered to 231 consumers of internal cybersecurity services. The sam- ple was not random, nor blindly selected; instead it was directed at stakeholders who engaged with secur- ity teams on CTI in the recent past. Of the 231 surveys sent out, 93 responses were received (Executives: 2; Senior Management: 9; Management: 17: Operational roles: 65). The practitioner-researcher recognised the risk of potential bias, should he conduct the analysis himself (cf., Iversen et al., </a>2004 <span style=" color: #000;">on separating different roles of an action researcher to address impartiality). As such, the analysis of the survey data was done by an independent team in the organisation.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">The survey results revealed a number of new insights. On average, the more senior a respondent was, the lower their confidence expressed in CTI. Further, stakeholders reported spending considerable time and effort interpreting or making sense of CTI rather than using it. This finding was consistent with stakeholders at all levels expressing concerns with conflicting,  fragmented  and/or  incomprehensible CTI leading to poor utilisation in the important prac- tices of prioritisation and planning.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">The findings also suggested that executives were largely unaffected by CTI primarily because the content rarely reached them. Managerial roles were more likely to report higher levels of confidence in CTI, more likely to use it in their planning, and less likely to report major conflicts in work expectations because they received tailored intelligence products with a close fit to their deliverables. In fact, managerial roles were also more likely to report favourable experiences with CTI if their work was short term/tactical in nature and required information that can be actioned immediately, for example, incident response. Managerial roles were less likely to report favourable experiences with CTI if their work was long term/strategic in nature and required information in need of extrapolation, or con- textualisation such as strategic forecasting.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">Operational roles expressed the most confidence in CTI, but their level of confidence varied depending on the source of the CTI. Operational personnel reported higher confidence in structured intelligence-sources (e.g., vulnerability scanning), which was presented in a consistent format month-on-month, and lower con- fidence in unstructured data (e.g., CTI advisories). Aligning with this, operational roles were more likely to use this data in their day-to-day operations because of the available detail. This, however, did not translate into any strategic or planning activities, as these typi- cally did not apply given the scope of their operational responsibilities.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">The analysis revealed that many stakeholders reluc- tantly engaged with CTI staff and processes out of obligation. This was at odds with the emerging cyber threat landscape that demands an engaged “comba- tant” rather than a bureaucratic “compliant” mindset. Clearly, any CTI solution would require a parallel behavioural change process to enlist these “reluctant combatants”. This socio-cultural insight became the basis for both solution development and enterprise- wide integration.</p></li><li data-list-text="3.3.3."><h3 style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: -29pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark34">&zwnj;</a>CTI solution development &amp; integration</h3><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">To summarise, the survey revealed that CTI was diffi- cult to consume from the recipients’ perspective (Problem 1); CTI did not reach all recipients e.g., executive consumers (Problem 2); CTI had opera- tional utility, but lacked strategic utility (Problem 3); and, CTI consumption was driven by obligation, not as a business imperative (Problem 4).</p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark59" style=" color: black; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 10.5pt;">In response, the practitioner-researcher developed and formalised four design principles to guide integra- tion of CTI across the enterprise. These four design principles map to the nine quality attributes of threat intelligence (refer Literature review, and </a><a href="#bookmark59" class="s11">Figure </a>3<span style=" color: #000;">):</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ol id="l5"><li data-list-text="3.3.3.1."><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: -38pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark35">&zwnj;</a><span class="s22">Consolidated   and   consistent. </span>Threat Intelligence  must  be  multi-source  (to  achieve <i>Accuracy  and  Precision</i>),  vetted  (to  achieve</p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">Reliability<span class="p">),  and  consolidated  (to  achieve </span>Completeness<span class="p">) prior to release; this approach must be systematic and consistent (to address Problem 1).</span></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li data-list-text="3.3.3.2."><p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: -37pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark36">&zwnj;</a><span class="s22">Centralised and unified. </span>Threat Intelligence functions must be centralised and standardised (to achieve <i>Accuracy </i>and <i>Precision</i>) to reduce conflicting accounts of threats (to address Problem 1).</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li data-list-text="3.3.3.3."><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: -38pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark37">&zwnj;</a><span class="s22">Responsive, timely and targeted. </span>Threat Intelligence and responsive actions must have clear points of distribution (to achieve <i>Relevance</i>) and deliv- ered  prior  to  contingent  decisions  (to  achieve <i>Timeliness</i>) (to address Problem 2).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li data-list-text="3.3.3.4."><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: -38pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark38">&zwnj;</a><span class="s22">Accessible   and   pre-analysed. </span>Threat Intelligence must be presented as a consumable deli- verable that is <i>Usable, Tailored </i>and <i>Predictive </i>(to address Problem 3 and to some extent Problem 4).</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">Based on the survey, the practitioner-researcher realised that if the enterprise were to leverage CTI to best advantage, it had to be provisioned in such a way that stakeholders would be motivated to use it by a business imperative linked to their self- interest. Thus, the practitioner-researcher decided that stakeholders had to be acclimated to adversar- ial environments where they would be compelled to consume  CTI  to  ensure  their  cybersecurity. Further, the ramifications of ignoring CTI had to be felt. Hence the existing provision of CTI aimed at fulfiling general compliance obligations was ter- minated. Instead, cybersecurity began to conceptua- lise CTI-as-a-service to the enterprise, built to meet the needs of its stakeholders – the reluctant com- batants  –  while  also  advancing  cybersecurity’s objectives.</p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: justify;">CTI-as-a-service encompasses the original mili-</p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark59" style=" color: black; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 10.5pt;" name="bookmark57">tary intelligence principles of what makes intelli- gence valuable and actionable to an organisation (</a><a href="#bookmark59" class="s11">Figure  </a>3<a href="#bookmark97" style=" color: black; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 10.5pt;">).  CTI-as-a-service  represents  a  novel practical approach to embodying both CTI as an innovation  and  incorporating  a  socio-cultural change element across the enterprise. Internal ser- vices are already well understood by commercial managers (as consumers of such services). The concept of CTI-as-a-service draws on prior infor- mation systems research that have approached the delivery and support of complex technical phenom- ena for business users in the form of a service (Scheepers, </a>2006<a href="#bookmark105" style=" color: black; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 10.5pt;">; Weill &amp; Broadbent, </a>1998<a href="#bookmark105" style=" color: black; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 10.5pt;">). For example,  Weill  and  Broadbent (</a>1998<span style=" color: #000;">)  illustrate how enterprise-wide IT infrastructure can be con- sidered as a suite of services encompassing people, processes, and technology. The benefits of a service approach include broader engagement with busi- ness and understanding of technology phenomena delivered as services.</span><a name="bookmark58">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark59">&zwnj;</a>Figure 3. <span class="s21">Design principles and impact assessment of CTI-as-a-service.</span></h4><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li data-list-text="3.3.3.5."><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: -37pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark39">&zwnj;</a><span class="s22">People. </span>From the survey, it was clear that business users would need support to effectively engage with CTI-as-a-service. Greenback introduced a number of specialist CTI managers (or “handlers”) recruited from the defence industry whose primary task was to support the needs, context and priorities of CTI business users and direct the existing collection and analysis of CTI to ensure the outcome was <i>acces- sible and pre-analysed </i>to meet their operational and strategic needs.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li data-list-text="3.3.3.6."><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: -38pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark40">&zwnj;</a><span class="s22">Processes. </span>Re-configuration   and   re- engineering of processes were needed to: (1) transfer cyber-risk affecting business areas to the responsible business managers, (2) re-task criticality ratings in enterprise risk management processes to incorporate intentionality of threat actors, (3) scale up internal CTI processes to include distribution beyond IT operations, and (4) integrate with business risk teams so consumers would receive CTI that was <i>consolidated and consistent </i>with routine business risk reporting.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li data-list-text="3.3.3.7."><p style="padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: -38pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark41">&zwnj;</a><span class="s22">Technology. </span>A new digital platform was needed to <i>centralise and unify </i>all CTI. This single platform would replace a number of standalone sys- tems that previously generated CTI reporting largely on an ad hoc basis from various teams (e.g., penetra- tion testers, incident responders, threat intelligence analysts).</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">CTI-as-a-service  was  developed  as  follows. Criticality ratings used to identify and prioritise the severity of risks to specific environments were re- tasked to include intentionality (of cyber threat</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">actors). Intentionality was measured in terms of the capability of a particular threat actor, the perceived attractiveness of the asset to the actor, and the level of exposure of the asset to the actor. This called for novel enterprise-wide risk modelling across organisational systems and assets, including the creation of new risk dashboards for managers and development of appro- priate metrics. Importantly, in this process CTI end- users (both operational and managerial staff) were trained in using these resources to support their threat-based decision making. By integrating threat intelligence with routine business risk reporting, the ramifications of ignoring this intelligence was realised by business stakeholders. Effectively, CTI-as-a-service became the vehicle for transferring cybersecurity risks previously owned by the cybersecurity function, to managers responsible for areas affected by these threats. The combination of new risk modelling and dashboards as well as training for designated enter- prise stakeholders addressed the need for CTI to be responsive, timely and targeted in the form of CTI-as</p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark60" style=" color: black; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 10.5pt;">-a-service. </a>Table 1 <span style=" color: #000;">summarises details of the service,</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">service level agreements, support and resourcing.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li></ol></li><li data-list-text="3.3.4."><h3 style="padding-left: 35pt;text-indent: -29pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark42">&zwnj;</a>Implementing CTI-as-a-service across the enterprise</h3><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark56" style=" color: black; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 10.5pt;">The practitioner-researcher observed that although the alerts and advice from the threat intelligence team played a critical role in the IT operations unit’s situation awareness of the threat landscape and response to orga- nised, persistent and sophisticated cyber-attacks (refer </a><a href="#bookmark56" class="s11">Figure </a>2<span style=" color: #000;">), true cyber resilience requires agile cyber defence across the enterprise.

The development of the relationship between CTI provi- ders and users occurred iteratively. Users could express unmet requirements and areas for improve- ment in the service.

At the time of writing this study, there was no single inclusive framework in the formal literature that could be used to benchmark and reflect upon the organisational adoption and integration of CTI-as</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">-a-service as described in this clinical study.</p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark101" style=" color: black; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 10.5pt;">In considering how to measure the impact of CTI implementation on cybersecurity performance, it is useful to revisit the role and function of CTI in organisations. CTI is fundamentally information that has been subjected to a formal process of collec- tion and analysis with the precise objective to inform decision-makers about specific threats, risks and opportunities. Given the role of CTI is to make the cybersecurity  behaviour  of  the  firm  “proactive, anticipatory and dynamic” (Shin &amp; Lowry, </a>2020<a href="#bookmark101" style=" color: black; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 10.5pt;">, p. 6), without CTI, the firm is unaware of the who, what, when, how and why of the attack and the threat actors. As a result, their response can only be reactive, and they must assume the worst-case scenario. With CTI, the firm is able to “engineer more precise defense strategies” (Shin &amp; Lowry, </a>2020<span style=" color: #000;">, p. 1).</span></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: justify;">Therefore, given the role and function of CTI in</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">organisations, our study reflects the following logic. Cybersecurity performance is lowered by reactive and undirected defensive behaviours.

As a result of the behavioural transfor- mation, we found evidence that cybersecurity posture becomes stronger (refer </a><a href="#bookmark111" class="s11">Appendix </a>B<span style=" color: #000;">).</span></p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark107" style=" color: black; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 10.5pt;">We provide evidence of behavioural transformation driven by CTI implementation. This shows that the organisation has successfully transitioned its beha- viour from being reactive and undirected to being proactive and directed (refer </a><a href="#bookmark107" class="s11">Appendix </a>A<a href="#bookmark108" style=" color: black; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 10.5pt;">, </a><a href="#bookmark108" class="s11">Tables A1, </a>A2<span style=" color: #000;">). For example, a strong indicator is a distinct shift in the amount of time invested by incident responders from the late phases of the kill chain (“putting out the fire”) to the early phases of the kill chain (“preventing the fire from starting”). A second strong indicator is the change in incident response behaviour, from being undirected to directed. A third indicator is discovery of previously unknown vulnerabilities or attack sur- face that is exposed to cyber-attack.</span></p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark111" style=" color: black; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 10.5pt;">While we argue that there is no direct causal link between CTI implementation and cybersecurity per- formance, changes in the indicators (refer </a><a href="#bookmark111" class="s11">Appendix </a>B<a href="#bookmark112" style=" color: black; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 10.5pt;">, </a><a href="#bookmark112" class="s11">Tables B1, </a>B2<a href="#bookmark112" style=" color: black; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 10.5pt;">) suggest a significant impact which could not be realised in the absence of effective CTI implementation. </a><a href="#bookmark112" class="s11">Table </a>B1 <a href="#bookmark113" style=" color: black; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 10.5pt;">provides qualitative mea- sures for the positive impact of CTI implementation on the firm’s response to purposive and malicious cyber-threat actors using five operational indicators. </a><a href="#bookmark113" class="s11">Table </a>B2 <span style=" color: #000;">describes comparable actual scenarios, pre- CTI implementation and post-CTI implementation. Taken together these scenarios demonstrate that the firm has indeed transformed its response from being reactive (and acting on the worst-case scenario) to being proactive and pre-empting the attack. These scenarios are reflective of the organisation’s improved response against purposive and malicious threat actors.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: justify;">Based on the evidence of behavioural and opera-</p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark63" style=" color: black; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 10.5pt;">tional impact (as summarised in </a><a href="#bookmark63" class="s11">Table </a>2<span style=" color: #000;">), our overall evaluation of the adoption and integration of CTI at Greenback Financial is that it has significantly and measurably improved the organisations cyber security posture.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li></ol></li><li data-list-text="4."><h2 style="padding-left: 20pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark62">&zwnj;</a>Discussion and conclusion</h2></li></ol><p class="s18" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark56" style=" color: black; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 10.5pt;">This clinical study illustrates how military intelligence principles can be adapted and packaged in a form that is suitable and applicable to the commercial context. We believe the essence of Greenback’s journey, nota- bly the way that CTI was initially adopted in their cyber security function (</a><a href="#bookmark56" class="s11">Figure </a>2<a href="#bookmark59" style=" color: black; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 10.5pt;">), then subsequently adapted as an innovation in the form of CTI-as-a-ser- vice for enterprise-wide implementation (</a><a href="#bookmark59" class="s11">Figure </a>3<span style=" color: #000;">), is transferable to similar commercial organisational</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">contexts.  Importantly,  this  study  provides a comprehensive description of the clinical practice to transition from a reactive and undirected response rooted in compliance towards precise defensive stra- tegies driven by threat intelligence. A transition of this magnitude is inherently socio-technical in nature, encompassing not only CTI as technical innovation, but its ripple effect on the rest of the business, opera- tional processes, functional relationships, and beha- vioural change and ultimately manifests in improved cybersecurity posture. As illustrated in this clinical case, progress on this journey should be assessed on a number of measures, reflective of this social- technical change (refer Appendix).</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">The study makes the following specific contribu- tions to clinical practice. First, the approach whereby CTI as innovation is initially adopted and implemen- ted within cyber security operations (Phase 1), and is subsequently  integrated  across  the  organisation (Phase 2) denotes a useful stage-based roadmap for the deployment CTI in commercial organisations.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">Second, CTI-as-a-service represents a novel solu- tion to package and customise generically sourced cyber threat intelligence in a form that can be disse- minated and acted upon by specific business units. This allows for customisation of the service for parti- cular business areas, even for specific managers, enabling and training them to prioritise and act upon specific threat intelligence more effectively, com- pared  to  the  former  compliance-driven  model. Moreover, accompanying service support (defence- trained handlers, centralised digital platform), adds efficiency in delivering the service that is part of rou- tine business operations.</p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark60" style=" color: black; font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 10.5pt;">Third, as cyber security is increasingly pertinent to many organisational processes and activities, CTI-as-a-service  can  be  further  scaled  up  and extended  in  line  with  organisational  strategies, geographic expansion and emerging cyber threats. CTI-as-a-service is a mechanism to integrate the cybersecurity function (as providers) and business users (as customers). Given the inherently specu- lative nature of threat intelligence, on occasion, business  managers  will  be  called  to  act  upon false  alarms.  Mutual  understanding,  trust,  and respect is central to this increasingly important organisational relationship (thus the inclusion of personalised briefings as part of CTI-as-a-service, refer </a><a href="#bookmark60" class="s11">Table </a>1<span style=" color: #000;">). In turn, this implies that organisa- tions’  cybersecurity  functions  must  also  trans- form – becoming central to business operations and  strategic  planning,  as  opposed  to  a  back- office function.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: justify;">Last, the study also contributes to information</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">security risk management theory.

We argue that in the case of purposive threat actors, cyber-security risk is not  probabilistic  but  possibilistic.  Organisations should realise that possibilistic cyber-risks are inher- ently unpredictable and there is no determinate rela- tionship between investment in security safeguards and reduction in risk exposure. To address possibilis- tic cyber-risks, organisations must introduce two new externally focused constructs, i.e., cyber-threat actors’ </span>intentionality <span class="p">and </span>capability <span class="p">into their risk calculus.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: justify;">An  externally-focused  risk  calculus  is  better suited  to  the  emerging  cyber-threat  landscape typified by high  volume, sophisticated and tar- geted  attacks.  The  clinical  study  describes  the experience of an organisation that designed and implemented an enterprise-wide solution, founded on  this  externally  focused  risk  calculus.  CTI redresses the information asymmetry that sophis- ticated cyber threat actors have over organisations. The practical reality is no longer <i>if </i>an attack will take place, but <i>when (timing)</i>, by <i>whom (attacker), why (motive), how (tactics)</i>, and <i>where (targets)</i>. CTI-as-a-service provides managers with critical operational,  tactical  and  strategic  information about  these  questions,  enabling  them  to  direct their  cyber-defence  function  against  purposive and malicious attacks.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">To  the  best  of  our  knowledge,  this  clinical study is the first of its kind that demonstrates how a large commercial organisation has adopted and integrated CTI as a means to successfully transform its cybersecurity defence behaviour.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">In terms of limitations, for reasons of confiden- tiality, we were limited in the amount of detail we could provide in this paper.

The responses to each of these vulnerabilities occurred pre- and post-CTI implementation respectively. Both vulnerabilities were assessed at the highest level of criticality.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Pre-CTI Implementation                              Post-CTI Implementation</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: -8pt;text-align: left;">Greenback became aware of active threats exploiting Vuln-20, but was unable to form a consistent view of likely attack surfaces, or points of entry. The eventual direction of the response was informed by</p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">a detection of malicious activity in an adjacent environment, which was traced back to use of the exploitation of this vulnerability. The response, therefore, was consistently behind the threat actor – having little reliable knowledge of their modus operandi, or objectives. Unable to pre-empt or keep pace with attackers, Greenback was forced to isolate the affected environments from the broader network; stemming the spread of the threat at the cost of material disruption to enterprise systems and operations.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: -8pt;text-align: left;">Greenback was targeted by a similar threat actor, exploiting a similar vulnerability, Vuln-21. Through established channels with peer organisations and private vendors, CTI was able to obtain indicators of compromise (IoCs), logs, IP addresses, signatures, and other technical indicators observed and confirmed as “signals” before a threat actor attempted a full-scale compromise. Having established a credible threat, the cybersecurity function reached out to business teams and asset owners to arrange downtime for mitigations to be put in place. Teams were deployed specifically to defend the assets at risk, and a high- priority response process was used to expedite patching – mitigating the vulnerability entirely. There was no meaningful disruption to business operations, and the attack never proceeded, the attacker having lost the opportunity to establish a meaningful foothold.</p></body></html>
