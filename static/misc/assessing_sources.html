Understanding the threat landscape and the adversaries’ attack tactics to perform it represent key factors for enabling an eﬃcient defense against threats over the time. Of particular importance is the acquisition of timely and accu- rate information from threats intelligence sources available on the web which can provide additional intelligence on emerging threats even before they can be observed as actual attacks. Currently, speciﬁc indicators of compromise (e.g. IP addresses, domains, hashsums of malicious ﬁles) are shared in a semi- automated and structured way via so-called threat feeds. Unfortunately, current systems have to deal with the trade-off between the timeliness of such an alert (i.e. warning at the ﬁrst mention of a threat) and the need to wait for veriﬁcation by other sources (i.e. warning after multiple sources have veriﬁed the threat). In addition, due to the increasing number of open sources, it is challenging to ﬁnd the right balance between feasibility and costs in order to identify a relatively small subset of valuable sources. In this paper, a method to automate the assessment of cyber threat intelligence sources and predict a relevance score for each source is proposed. Speciﬁcally, a model based on meta-data and word embed- ding is deﬁned and experimented by training regression models to predict the relevance score of sources on Twitter. The results evaluation show that the assigned score allows to reduce the waiting time for intelligence veriﬁcation, on the basis of its relevance, thus improving the time advantage of early threat detection.</p><p class="s16" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: right;">© 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Other efforts are related to malware analysis and intrusion detection sys- tems for threat intelligence on a technical level, for example by generating speciﬁc indicators of compromise (IOC) in a machine- readable format. This offers a high potential for CTI with regards to the atomic indicators or host and network artifacts from a detected attack (</a><a href="#bookmark82" class="s17">Mavroeidis and Bromander, </a>2017<span style=" color: #000;">), however it is mostly lim- ited to </span><span class="s25">situational awareness </span><span style=" color: #000;">and </span><span class="s25">imminent threats </span><a href="#bookmark93" class="s26">towards a spe- ciﬁc organization (</a><a href="#bookmark93" class="s17">Robertson, </a>2017<a href="#bookmark76" class="s26">). Indeed, the current approaches are not designed to provide threat analysts with a broader “under- standing of an adversary’s capabilities” or even general “knowledge about the adversaries themselves”. This scenario and as timeliness is essential in security emphasize the need to determine the rele- vance of such information not only based on whether it is widely spread but also on the quality and informativeness of the source itself (</a><a href="#bookmark76" class="s17">Tounsi and Rais, </a>2018<span style=" color: #000;">).</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">On the one hand there is a number of software or hardware vendors aiming to inform their customers about current threats to-</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cose.2021.102576">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cose.2021.102576</a></p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">0167-4048/© 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Different publishers provide cyber threat-related information on vulnerabilities, adversaries or imminent attack campaigns in the Web. Many cyber security pro- fessionals, vendors and researchers announce their ﬁndings on business or personal websites, blogs and social media, which can be assumed to have the highest quality in terms of credibility and technical detail. However, even some hackers post informa- tion about ongoing attack campaigns or new vulnerabilities on social media like Twitter and on some forums and marketplaces in the darkweb. This information might often reach cyber secu- rity professionals rather late and to be unprepared for such at- tacks (</a><a href="#bookmark94" class="s17">Sabottke et al., </a>2015<a href="#bookmark76" class="s26">). Obviously, this information varies strongly with regards to credibility, timeliness and level of detail, and it is diﬃcult to acquire and assess it in an automated manner since the sources do not only vary content-wise but also regard- ing their structure and syntax. Nonetheless, these sources have al- ready proven to hold valuable additional information for an orga- nization’s defense against cyber attacks (</a><a href="#bookmark76" class="s17">Tounsi and Rais, </a>2018<a href="#bookmark82" class="s26">). To understand these evolving threats, it is essential for security ex- perts to illuminate the threat landscape including adversaries, their tools and techniques (</a><a href="#bookmark82" class="s17">Mavroeidis and Bromander, </a>2017<a href="#bookmark93" class="s26">), as well as learn about the details of cyber threats relevant sources and prior- ite them (</a><a href="#bookmark93" class="s17">Robertson, </a>2017<a href="#bookmark71" class="s26">). It is simply not practical to implement counter-measures in a timely and economical manner for all possi- ble attacks including 0-day exploits, i.e. exploits that target vulner- abilities that the defenders do not know about it yet (</a><a href="#bookmark71" class="s17">Stone, </a>2021<a href="#bookmark57" class="s26">). For this reason, automating the collection of CTI (</a><a href="#bookmark57" class="s17">Dalziel et al., 2015</a><a href="#bookmark57" class="s26">) (i.e. publicly accessible data on the internet) can represent </a><span style=" color: #000;">a viable approach to improve the defense capabilities against cyber threats, but of course it requires to face with the selection of the most relevant sources, the balancing between precision and time- liness that lead to an earlier generation of threat alerts.</span></p><p class="s27" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark23" class="s26" name="bookmark2">In this direction, this paper proposes an approach for the au- tomated assessment of the OSINT sources themselves as an ad- ditional criterion for the relevance of CTI. In particular, an up- stream assessment of the publishing source itself is taken into ac- count, both when generating intelligence-based alerts and to de- cide whether a source should be used for CTI collection or not. In particular, a speciﬁc OSINT source was selected based on a survey conducted among cyber security professionals and academic re- searchers who are working in the ﬁeld of threat intelligence. Then two feature sets, that characterize the OSINT source were deﬁned. A scoring function to quantify the relevance of an OSINT source with regards to CTI by particularly considering the timeliness was proposed. The experimentation was conducted by training 5 re- gression models on both feature sets to predict the relevance score for OSINT sources, by focusing on Twitter, and compared with re- lated approaches.

It proposes a ranking mechanism, based on supervised machine learning, to automate the evaluation of open-source CTI sources by selecting a subset of sources for CTI collection. It has been showed that monitoring a subset of users on Twitter can be suﬃcient to retrieve most of the vulnerability-related information that is available on the microblogging platform. The authors discussed the growing rate of vulnerability discovery over the years a well as their publication through coordinated disclosure processes which often leads to a ﬂood of vulnerability disclosures within a narrow time frame. However, this raised the challenge to select such users, i.e. sources, on Twitter depending on their informativeness and relevance for early exploit detection by proposing a new measurement to quan- tiﬁed each user’s utility based on their number of relevant tweets related to real-world exploits. Moreover, even it is an important ground for the scope of this current work, (i) no ranking or scoring of the actual sources and their relevance was provided and, (ii) they did not considered the detection of emerging malware and 0-day attacks.</p><p class="s27" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;"><span class="s25">Evaluation  of  Trust  in  the  Quality  of  CTI  Sources  </span><a href="#bookmark68" class="s26">In </a><a href="#bookmark68" class="s17">Schaberreiter et al. </a>(2019)<a href="#bookmark90" class="s26">, the need for a quantitative evalua- tion of CTI sources is discussed and then an adaptive methodology for a weighted evaluation of such sources was proposed by using Structured Threat Information Expression (STIX) </a><a href="#bookmark90" class="s17">OASIS </a>Open<span style=" color: #000;">, that is a language for describing cyber threat information, which is used to exchange CTI in a structured manner. The methodology introduces six evaluation categories on the basis of intelligence source aspects: (i) type of information, (ii) provider classiﬁca- tion, (iii) licensing options, (iv) interoperability, (v) advanced API support and (vi) context applicability. Each category was evaluated through multiple parameters, represented as numeric values, which described the quality of the CTI within a closed world view. This means that all sources were only compared against other sources within the monitored community of CTI sources. Unfortunately, the use of only structured data (i.e. data ﬁelds of the STIX format) represents a big limit of their methodology, furthermore, as the same authors stated, other infor- mation such as the timeliness based on the time passed was not considered.</span></p><p class="s25" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">Sec-Buzzer <a href="#bookmark75" class="s26">A system for the detection of emerging topics related to cyber threats from expert communities on Twitter, called Sec- Buzzer, was presented in </a><a href="#bookmark75" class="s17">Lee et al. </a><span class="s27">(2017)</span><span class="p">. It automatically iden- tiﬁes new experts on Twitter and adds them to a list of OSINT sources. The most active users in posting information are then further assessed according to their topic-relevance by examining the number of times they were mentioned in tweets and retweets by the most active existing experts. The remaining candidates are then ﬁltered using the number of their tweets that contain key- words from a predeﬁned list of relevant topics. These users are then proposed as additional expert candidates and manually con- ﬁrmed. Then, all expert-users were weighted according to two hy- potheses: (i) if expert A is followed by another expert B with a higher weight, the weight of expert A increases, (ii) the more at- tention an expert can attract, the higher is the weight for this ex- pert. The main lack of this approach is that the user’s activeness, as initial selection criterion, considers users with a high frequency of tweeting as experts. However, even among cybersecurity-related Twitter accounts the number of tweets within a given time frame might not necessarily characterize a valuable threat intelligence source.</span></p><p class="s25" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">Early Warning of Cyber Threats <a href="#bookmark95" class="s26">In </a><a href="#bookmark95" class="s17">Sapienza et al. </a><span class="s27">(2017a)</span><span class="p">, Twit- ter textual data is explored to generate alerts on emerging cy- ber threats like DDoS attacks and data breaches.

If such tokens can also be observed in hacking- related online discussions in the darkweb, they are considered rel- evant CTI, thus reporting them as alerts. All alerts were manually annotated to determine the overall precision of the system, based on the 661 alerts issued on a period of 5 months with 83.1% preci- sion. One case showed that the “Mirai” botnet-based DDoS attack was mentioned on Twitter more than 1 month before the attack happened, and 3 weeks before exploits were shared on the dark- web, by highlighting the potential of CTI from OSINT sources as Twitter.</p><p class="s27" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;"><span class="s25">DISCOVER </span><a href="#bookmark66" class="s26">In </a><a href="#bookmark66" class="s17">Sapienza et al. </a>(2018) <a href="#bookmark95" class="s26">a system called DISCOVER, based on </a><a href="#bookmark95" class="s17">Sapienza et al.</a> (2017a) <span style=" color: #000;">and centered on natural language processing (NLP), is presented.

These rules were used to prevent a high false positive rate and thereby they achieved 84% precision for warnings based on data from Twit- ter. Five case studies were conducted to evaluate the system. They showed that DISCOVER issued a warning for the new term “wan- nacry” on April 18, 2017 which was about 3 weeks in advance to the wide-spread outbreak of the Wannacry ransomware.

The considered relevant infor- mation on cyber threats was extracted on the basis of the Secu- rity Vulnerability Concept Extractor (SVCE). The relations between these entities are described using a Uniﬁed Cybersecurity Ontol- ogy (UCO) and stored in a Cybersecurity Knowledge Base (KB). Any reoccurring intelligence was used to update the database which stores a number of properties on each entry. The automatic iden- tiﬁcation and generation of warnings was based on a set of prop- erties, such as, the maximum time period for which intelligence is considered relevant. Additionally, and through the use of a rule set written in Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL), custom user</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">system proﬁles could be conﬁgured by deﬁning, for example, for which software and hardware some warnings should be gener- ated. The approach was evaluated through human assessment by doctoral students in the ﬁeld of cybersecurity and using data col- lected over a ten-day time frame. It showed that 57.2% of all in- spected entities extracted by the SVCE were marked correctly and 33.2% were partially correct. From a total of 37 relevant intelligence entries the system generated 15 warnings, 13 of them were as- sessed as “useful” and the 2 remaining were “maybe useful”. Then, 300 discarded tweets were manually examined by obtaining 85% recall.</p><p class="s27" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark88" class="s30">Cyber-All-Intel </a><a href="#bookmark88" class="s17">Mittal et al. </a><a href="#bookmark86" class="s17">(2017c) </a><a href="#bookmark86" class="s26">extends </a><a href="#bookmark86" class="s17">Mittal et al.

The approach was evaluated by manually annotating 60 alerts from which 49 were marked correct. Furthermore, the SPARQL query engine was evaluated by searching for concepts that were marked “similar” by the annotators. Best results were reached for word embeddings with a dimensionality of 1500 and term frequency 2. Overall, the vector embeddings performed better than the knowledge graph when searching for similar attacks, products and vulnerabilities.

Each tweet and CVE description was con- verted into a numerical vector representation where each feature is the Term Frequency-Invert Document Frequency (TF-IDF) for all document terms. Afterwards, the Centroid and the One-class Sup- port Vector Machine (OCSVM) novelty classiﬁers were trained us- ing these features. Both classiﬁers were compared to typical SVM, MLP, CNN, on a data set collected over 12 months in 2018, by showing that the centroid novelty classiﬁer, using the cosine simi- larity distance, performed slightly better than the OCSVM with 85% Precision and 52% Recall, from a total of 232 cyber threat-related tweets.

Typically, the collection of indicators of compromise (IOC) from security articles would mean that the intelligence might already be outdated due to the time it takes from the occurrence of a threat until the publication of the corresponding security ar- ticle. However, this approach does not aim to utilize these IOC in day-to-day security operations but rather to gather general in- sight into the stages of malware campaigns. Therefore, a word em- bedding algorithm was used to classify all IOCs according to four pre-deﬁned stages of such campaigns (i.e. baiting, exploitation, in- stallation, command &amp; control). During the evaluation 91.9% Pre- cision and 97.8% Recall for the IOC detection was reached and the stage classiﬁcation through word embeddings resulted in an average Precision of 78.2%. From such experiments, insights into some attack patterns and strategies applied by threat actors, which corresponds to the high-level intelligence of the CTI model, were gathered.</span></p><p class="s27" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark53" class="s26">Other research contributions that dealt with other aspects, within threat intelligence ﬁeld, are available in the literature.

Regard- ing social media users, for example Twitter accounts, two related approaches have been researched: (i) assessing the credibility of tweets about live events like natural disasters (</a><a href="#bookmark69" class="s17">Krzysztof et al., 2015</a><a href="#bookmark83" class="s26">; </a><a href="#bookmark69" class="s17">Yang et al., 2019</a><a href="#bookmark58" class="s26">; </a><a href="#bookmark69" class="s17">Hassan, 2018</a><a href="#bookmark67" class="s26">; </a><a href="#bookmark69" class="s17">Khodabakhsh et al., 2018</a><a href="#bookmark73" class="s26">) and (ii) the detection of inﬂuencers who are often considered to be experts for a speciﬁc topic </a><a href="#bookmark89" class="s26">(</a><a href="#bookmark89" class="s17">Nebot et al., </a><a href="#bookmark73" class="s17">2018</a><a href="#bookmark73" class="s26">; </a><a href="#bookmark73" class="s17">Subbian </a><a href="#bookmark59" class="s17">and </a><a href="#bookmark73" class="s17">Melville, 2011</a><a href="#bookmark70" class="s26">; </a><a href="#bookmark73" class="s17">Lahuerta-Otero and Cordero-Gutiérrez, 2016</a><a href="#bookmark73" class="s26">; </a><a href="#bookmark59" class="s17">Chu and Kim, 2011</a><a href="#bookmark59" class="s26">).

This means that a direct comparison of the results, performances, and solutions also with our work is only possible to a limited extent. This is due to (i) the lack of standard- ized or suﬃciently extensive data sets publicly available for cyber threat intelligence from OSINT sources (</a><a href="#bookmark55" class="s17">Bridges et al., </a>2017<span style=" color: #000;">), and</span></p><p class="s27" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark72" class="s26">(ii) the methods used to acquire such data sets are not described in detail in the relted works and cannot be reproduced.

The main lack is due to the limited inspection to the textual data by neglecting the sources themselves for automated threat detection and warn- ing generation, as further highlighted in the following section.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li data-list-text="3."><h1 style="padding-left: 16pt;text-indent: -10pt;text-align: justify;">Motivations, background and challenges</h1><p style="padding-top: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s27" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark82" class="s26">Different types of CTIs are usually being utilized on different levels of an organization’s defenses (e.g. to create new ﬁrewall rules, to inspect network traﬃc and prioritize security patching), which are formalized in </a><a href="#bookmark82" class="s17">Mavroeidis and Bromander </a>(2017)<span style=" color: #000;">. Specif- ically, low-level threat intelligence categories (i.e. “Target”, “Atomic Indicators” and “Indicators of Compromise”) are summarized as in- dicators of compromise (IOC), such as IP addresses, domains, hash- sums of malicious ﬁles etc., that are known to presented threats in the past or present. Such intelligence is often easier to obtain, share and process in an automated manner, since it is the most structured intelligence with a ﬁxed CTI format or syntax. The three lower levels of CTI are then followed by the mid-level categories (i.e.“Tools” and “TTPs”) that stand for tactics, techniques and pro- cedures of a threat actor. They can sometimes overlap since the tools used by attackers could fall into the category “TTPs”, that is why they are summarized as TTP in this work; whereas high-level CTI categories are mostly of a strategic nature and only marginally relevant to this work.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark23" class="s26">Existing proof-of-concepts, as described in </a><a href="#bookmark23" class="s17">Section </a>2<a href="#bookmark66" class="s26">, have also shown that these sources have a potential to further improve in- sights into the cyber threat landscape which is not being fully uti- lized to date. For example, </a><a href="#bookmark66" class="s17">Sapienza et al. </a>(2018) <span style=" color: #000;">presented a case study explaining that their OSINT system detected mentions of the “wannacry” ransomware on Twitter about three weeks before the wide-spread infection of more than 200,000 computer systems across 150 countries. An automated warning at such an early point in time would most likely have been suﬃcient for many organiza- tions to protect their networks against the spread of this malware. However, no warning was generated at that time since the system was designed to wait for the occurrence of additional, conﬁrming intelligence in order to maintain an acceptable false positive rate.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark79" class="s26" name="bookmark4">Typical challenges for such an acquisition of CTI arise from the nature of the user-generated content that OSINT relies on. The less structured data normally lacks consistent metadata or syntax which requires at least basic techniques of natural language pro- cessing to even identify threat intelligence. Especially mid-level in- telligence, (i.e. emerging TTP and malwares), which is less struc- tured and has no speciﬁc format, is thereby harder to gather from large textual data sets like social media content. For example, the names of new malware families are not automatically obtained by intrusion detection systems, but rather assigned by security researchers. Narrowing the search for intelligence down to such sources that have a high probability of publishing relevant infor- mation is a non-trivial, yet important initial step to reduce noise in the data and simplify data cleaning considerably. In fact, both the quantity and the quality of the valuable information depends on the type of the selected CTIs and the OSINT sources from which they come. Many proof-of-concept systems introduced in recent research either focus only on a very limited subset of available sources for their evaluation or struggle to achieve near real-time monitoring of the OSINT sources due to the high amount of data. Such approaches might be diﬃcult to apply in real-world scenarios unless this issue can be overcome without accidentally excluding important sources from the scope of such a system and thereby re- ducing its recall. For the collection of vulnerability-related CTI from different sources on Twitter (i.e. micro-blogs), it could be shown that monitoring only a manageable subset of sources is suﬃcient to obtain relevant information, as lot of intelligence found on Twit- ter is spread via retweets and mentions but, it has its origin in a relatively small subset of sources </a><a href="#bookmark94" class="s26">(</a><a href="#bookmark94" class="s17">Sabottke et al., </a><a href="#bookmark79" class="s17">2015</a><a href="#bookmark79" class="s26">; </a><a href="#bookmark79" class="s17">Tundis and Mühlhäuser, 2017</a><a href="#bookmark78" class="s26">; </a><a href="#bookmark79" class="s17">Tundis et al., 2018</a><a href="#bookmark79" class="s26">).</a></p><p class="s27" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark80" class="s26" name="bookmark5">Identifying threat intelligence from OSINT sources is mostly achieved by processing the unstructured text before classiﬁcation algorithms </a><a href="#bookmark94" class="s26">(</a><a href="#bookmark94" class="s17">Sabottke et al., </a><a href="#bookmark80" class="s17">2015</a><a href="#bookmark84" class="s26">; </a><a href="#bookmark84" class="s17">Zhu and Dumitras, </a><a href="#bookmark80" class="s17">2018</a><a href="#bookmark80" class="s26">; </a><a href="#bookmark80" class="s17">Long et al., 2019</a><a href="#bookmark72" class="s26">; </a><a href="#bookmark80" class="s17">Le et al., 2019</a><a href="#bookmark80" class="s26">), or rule sets are used to decide </a><a href="#bookmark95" class="s26">whether it is considered real intelligence </a><a href="#bookmark66" class="s26">(</a><a href="#bookmark66" class="s17">Sapienza et al., </a><a href="#bookmark95" class="s17">2018</a><a href="#bookmark95" class="s26">; </a><a href="#bookmark95" class="s17">Sapienza et al., 2017a</a><a href="#bookmark88" class="s26">; </a><a href="#bookmark95" class="s17">Mittal et al., 2017c</a><a href="#bookmark86" class="s26">; </a><a href="#bookmark95" class="s17">Mittal et al., 2016a</a><a href="#bookmark95" class="s26">). When </a><a href="#bookmark23" class="s26">auto- matically generating alerts based on this intelligence, it is crucial that the false positive rate is kept low in order to prevent ﬂood- ing the cyber security analysts with alerts, and let them keep fo- cus on the most critical threats.

By contrast the mid-level intelligence like vulnerabili- ties, exploits or malware names typically originates from manual analysis by security researchers or other security experts which means that it is likely to be published from different OSINT sources on the web. Such intelligence can yield a high time advantage and allow further investigation into emerging threats even before at- tacks happen and network sensors detect them. However, not only this requires the monitoring of the right OSINT sources but also to apply speciﬁc method of ﬁltering or verifying the intelligence before alerts are generated and displayed to the human threat an- alyst. It can be safely assumed that each source type has its own characteristics along with certain advantages and drawbacks when it comes to real-world requirements and security objectives. Since no in-depth comparison of the different source types for CTI exists to the knowledge of the authors, the question arises which source types are preferred for mid-level CTI in real-world applications.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">In order to answer this question and thereby direct this work towards the most promising OSINT source types and criteria, an empirical study was conducted through an interview with 30 ex- perts (i.e. security professionals in the industry and academic se- curity researchers) in the ﬁeld of threat intelligence. They were re- cruited through direct contacts and by searching online services, like (e.g. LinkedIn) and double checking on the web page of their organization, for relevant keywords (e.g. cyber security, threat in- telligence, etc.). Only participants with dedicated IT security job description and a minimum of 5 years of experience in this ﬁeld were contacted and invited to participate in the online survey. While not all of them made regular use of OSINT CTI as part of their daily work, as it is emerged from the survey described in the following (e.g. application security experts), many of them ex- pressed that they were planning to utilize CTI and already had concrete expectations, thus contributing an additional perspective to the survey. Based on that, the overall goal of such survey was to provide a better insight into the cyber threat intelligence do- main and determine which OSINT source types are currently of in- terest for the domain experts and what characteristics are consid- ered during the evaluation when deciding which sources are worth monitoring. The survey was based on the following questions:</p><ol id="l4"><li data-list-text="1."><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: -9pt;text-align: left;">Which OSINT sources are being utilized in today’s CTI practice?</p></li><li data-list-text="2."><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: -10pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">What are the most important criteria/characteristics used to evaluate these sources?</p></li><li data-list-text="3."><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: -10pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">How do experts rate certain sources with regards to their qual- ity?</p></li><li data-list-text="4."><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: -10pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">What features do the experts consider when evaluating the se- lected sources?</p></li><li data-list-text="5."><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: -10pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">What type of cyber threat intelligence is already being collected today?</p></li><li data-list-text="6."><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: -10pt;text-align: left;">How do experts rate the demand for improved CTI collection?</p></li></ol><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">As one can see, these and many other interesting questions can be asked in such research ﬁeld.

As it is shown in </a><a href="#bookmark33" class="s17">Fig. </a>4<span style=" color: #000;">, by using the average value of the obtained values (by using checkboxes) as the threshold, it emerged that,</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 274pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark7">&zwnj;</a>the type of available data that can be retrieved for supporting fur- ther analysis on them. Furthermore, even if third-party websites were rated higher with regards to the level of detail, Twitter is seen as a much more timely source type. In addition, on Twit- ter users decide for themselves which content (Tweets) to publish, what their proﬁle’s description should be and which other users they want to be directly connected to (following). There are no ﬁxed categories for content or users since they are usually linked to certain topics through the use of hashtags. Combining these ﬁndings and the fact that Twitter provides uniﬁed metadata on each user, which allows for better assessment and comparison, the authors decided to investigate on Twitter as the OSINT source.<a name="bookmark31">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li data-list-text="4.3."><p class="s25" style="padding-left: 290pt;text-indent: -16pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark32">&zwnj;</a>Feature selection</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 54pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Fig. 3. <span class="s13">Importance of the evaluated characteristics.</span></h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">among the top-5 types of cyber threat intelligence, the demand for intelligence on <i>vulnerabilities and exploits </i>as well as <i>malwares </i>is generally higher.</p><p class="s27" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark34" class="s26">In addition, the participants were asked to rate the most com- mon OSINT source types from the related work: (i) public threat feeds, (ii) third-party websites and blogs, (iii) darkweb forums and marketplaces, (iv) Twitter, (v) Reddit, (vi) Pastebin and similar text &amp; code storage websites, as it is depicted in </a><a href="#bookmark34" class="s17">Fig. </a>5<span style=" color: #000;">, by applying a threshold-based approach.</span></p><p class="s27" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark32" class="s26">Since the types (iii - v) comprise many sources (i.e. user ac- counts) for which the same metadata (i.e. features) is available, the experts were asked to select the features (which are explained in more detail in the following subsection) that they considered promising or highly typical for valuable OSINT sources. They were also able to name additional features that they use when evaluat- ing sources (see </a><a href="#bookmark32" class="s17">Section </a>4.3<span style=" color: #000;">). On the basis of such insights, third- party blogs, websites and Twitter emerged as the preferred sources for intelligence on new vulnerabilities and malwares.

Therefore, no inves- tigations about the features of the sources themselves, that pro- vide CTI-related information, are known to the authors. Only few of them examined aspects of the source but none of them apply to the sources theirselves a feature-driven ML approach. On the other hand, various efforts were conducted to examine the role and characteristics of inﬂuencers on Twitter, such as, users who are considered authoritative within a certain topical domain, as well as metrics to quantify the credibility of tweets and Twitter users. These approaches are often based on features extracted from pro- ﬁle metadata, the social graph and textual data from tweets.</p><p class="s27" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark35" class="s26">Based on such information, the ﬁrst full set of features, which constists of the 26 metadata sources listed in </a><a href="#bookmark35" class="s17">Table </a>2<span style=" color: #000;">, has been selected by considering 3 aspects:</span></p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: -7pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">- <i>Proﬁle related features: </i>these are characteristics of a Twitter pro- ﬁle that are directly associated with the user proﬁle (e.g. <i>reg- istration date, the user’s speciﬁed location, number of followers </i>and so on).

To achieve that, a AI-based approach centered on Supervised Machine Learn- ing techniques has been adopted. This means that, starting from a initial data set, a part of it (i.e. training data) is used to deﬁne a classiﬁcation model on the basis of the features that we choose and proposed on the basis of our review analysis in combination with our intuitions, while another part of data (i.e. test data) is used to evaluate the goodness and performance of such derived model. In our case, the timeliness of each intelligence is used in combination with the total count of CTI published by a source to assign the CTI Relevance Score (by using proposed </a><a href="#bookmark38" class="s17">Eqs. </a>1 <a href="#bookmark37" class="s26">and </a>2<a href="#bookmark32" class="s26">, that are below described) to each source in the training data, on the basis of the above described features. This labeled training data is then used to train regression models for predicting the CTI Rele- vance Score for each source in the test dataset. The meta-data fea- ture set, that has been described in </a><a href="#bookmark32" class="s17">Section </a>4.3<a href="#bookmark64" class="s26">, consists of both static (e.g. “length_username”) and dynamic features (e.g. all infor- mation regarding retweets, mentions, etc.) between which no fur- ther distinction is made. Since the timeliness of the observed intel- ligence is essential for the CTI Relevance Score, any changes or ad- ditions to the training data can lead to variations in the predicted scores. Of course, as is well-known in the ﬁeld of machine learn- ing, adding a new source to the training data which published cer- tain intelligence much earlier than all the existing sources in the training data would require the whole data set to be relabeled, i.e. recalculating the CTI Relevance Score, and could therefore change the resulting regression model. But such research aspect, regarding the automatic adaptation of the classiﬁcation model over the time as described by Kauschke et al. in </a><a href="#bookmark64" class="s17">Kauschke and Fürnkranz </a>(2018)<span style=" color: #000;">, which focuses on the adaption of existing classiﬁcation models to new data, falls outside the scope of the current research, and con- sequently it is not considered.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">Instead, as already mentioned, such a supervised machine learning approach requires a labeled data set which means that the score needs to be deﬁned ﬁrst and then calculated for each source in data training data set. A naive score for the relevance could be achieved by using the count of true intelligence that was posted by a source during the observed time period. However, this would ignore two important aspects:</p><ol id="l6"><li data-list-text="i"><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: -6pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark29" class="s26">ﬁrstly, the timeliness of threat intelligence is a crucial require- ment as it emerged not only from the conducted survey that has been described in </a><a href="#bookmark29" class="s17">Section </a>4.2 <a href="#bookmark76" class="s26">but also from another sur- vey among security professionals from 2018 in </a><a href="#bookmark76" class="s17">Tounsi and Rais (2018)</a><a href="#bookmark76" class="s26">.

(3) Filtering of all tokens which are ’men- tions’, i.e. Twitter usernames or URLs that are already detected by Twitter and listed in the Tweet’s meta data.

(8) Split com- pound words which consist only of common and domain-speciﬁc words already found from the data set of the previous year. For ex- ample ’DNS-based’ is split into ’DNS’ and ’based’.

In particular, it visualizes the [0, 1]-normalized scores for all sources that are sorted on the hor- izontal axis according to their true intelligence count (baseline). The baseline (red) shows that the left-most sources are CTI sources that had high counts of true intelligence while other Twitter ac- counts like ’opera’ shared no or only very few cyber threat in- telligence. Comparing the baseline with the timeliness parameter (green) shows that some sources have published the same num- ber of CTI indicated by a small plateau in the red graph but dif- fer with regards to the timeliness of their intelligence, i.e. notice- able differences in the green graph for the same sources. The CTI Relevance Score (blue) can be considered a combination of the in- telligence count and the timeliness parameter with the difference that it applies a non-linear decay function to the timeliness of in- telligence as opposed to the timeliness parameter. It focuses more heavily on the timeliness which decreases more rapidly during the initial time period than with a linear approach and can be ob- served as higher variations in the scores. In the right segment of the graph (close to ’airbuscyber’), a noteworthy peak of the CTI Relevance Score can be observed, which shows that even sources which rarely publish intelligence (i.e. have a low overall count) still received a notably higher CTI Relevance score (blue line) compared to the other scoring functions as long as the intelligence was pub- lished in a timely manner (i.e. among the ﬁrst sources to report it). In other words, the focus on timeliness is once more high- lighted. In this case, it can be seen that, even though two sources have a low count of true intelligence (red graph), they were among the ﬁrst or maybe the only sources within the community that shared certain intelligence. Such behavior is especially relevant for sources that focus on CTI for niche software etc. That is to say, such sources might only share CTI for a certain product or regard- ing a certain threat that can still be of interest for security ex- perts. Using the other scores the source could easily be overlooked. As already mentioned above the Utility Score (orange) ignores the timeliness of intelligence but focuses on intelligence regarding vul- nerabilities (CVE) with high exploitability. Examining the peak in the graph for the source ’inj3ct0r’ suggests that this source pro- vides high counts of intelligence containing CVE identiﬁers for ex- ploitable vulnerabilities. It ﬁts in the picture that this source has</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark42">&zwnj;</a>Fig. 6. <span class="s13">CTI-Relevance-Score.</span></h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark43">&zwnj;</a>Fig. 7. <span class="s13">Absolute Error.</span></h2><p style="padding-top: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">a lower timeliness compared to its neighbors in the graph since it is to be expected that the investigation of the exploitability of CVE takes a certain amount of time and delays the sharing of such intelligence.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">Overall, the CTI Relevance Score seems to be comparable to the timeliness parameter but favors very fast CTI sources more heavily and can therefore detect sources that provide rare CTI for niche products or only regarding the source’s domain of expertise.</p><p class="s27" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark43" class="s26">Whereas, </a><a href="#bookmark43" class="s17">Fig. </a>7 <a href="#bookmark84" class="s26">shows the Absolute Error between the real value and the predicted ones, by sorting the sources (x-axis) in de- scending order based on their intelligence count.

Since the CTI Relevance Score and the cosine-similarity are both continuous values between zero and one, for both of them a threshold needs to be met by the CTI publish- ing source in order to be considered relevant and generate an early alert. In order to determine if a CTI source is relevant a threshold t needs to be established such that only sources with a score above t are classiﬁed relevant. </a><a href="#bookmark48" class="s17">Fig. </a>12<span style=" color: #000;">-(a) shows how the precision varies</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">for possible thresholds t between [0, 1].

The cosine-similarity to the third centroid (orange) reaches the highest precision but only for a rather high threshold which corresponds to a lower recall meaning that no alerts are issued for some true threat intelligence.

This shows that the cosine-similarity to the third centroid (or- ange) is actually performing worse than all other scores.

Interestingly, the cosine-similarity for</span></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 81%;text-align: right;"><a href="#bookmark66" class="s26">the ﬁrst centroid (green) has a F1-Score above the baseline from DISCOVER (</a><a href="#bookmark66" class="s17">Sapienza et al., </a><span style=" color: #0080AC;">2018</span>) for all thresholds up to <i>t </i><span class="s47">= </span>0<span class="s68">.</span>752.

This means that for any emerging CTI that is published by a source with a cosine-similarity above the selected threshold, an immedi- ate alert is generated instead of waiting for a second occurrence of it from a different source. This time delay in hours is calculated for each instance in the dataset, and showed in </a><a href="#bookmark49" class="s17">Fig. </a>13<span style=" color: #000;">, by con- sidering 50% of all intelligence available in the considered dataset,</span></p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark66" class="s26">thus achieving a time advantage in comparison to the related work (</a><a href="#bookmark66" class="s17">Sapienza et al., </a>2018<span style=" color: #000;">).

In case certain intelligence regarding niche products or threats is only shared by a single source within the community no alert would be generated at all since none of the other monitored sources veriﬁes the intelligence. To provide an insight into the real world applicability of this work’s approach can also be com- pared to the case study conducted in </a><a href="#bookmark66" class="s17">Sapienza et al. </a>(2018) <a href="#bookmark23" class="s26">where the ’DISCOVER’ system automatically generated a warning for the emerging “wannacry” ransomware threat.

For the term ’wannacry’ the ﬁrst warning was generated on the 18th of April 2017 when said constraint was met. However, the term was already observed be- fore this date and could have generated an earlier warning if a dif- ferent constraint was used to quantify the relevance of this intel- ligence. We preliminarily investigated the usage of this work’s ap- proach to predict the CTI Relevance Score of the source as an alter- native constraint.

Furthermore, such study showed that Twit- ter is seen as one of the most promising OSINT platform with re- gards to the timeliness of cyber threat intelligence; (ii) a method to collect cyber security-related data set via the Twitter API was realized and the labeling of true intelligence was automated us- ing the Open Threat Exchange as an external data source for ver- iﬁcation; (iii) two different feature sets were engineered from the acquired data set, whereas (iv) to quantify the relevance of threat intelligence sources the CTI Relevance Score was for- malized and compared to related scores from existing research effort.<a name="bookmark17">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark18">&zwnj;</a>Different regression models have been employed for the evalua- tion of the proposal. From the experiments emerged that the rele- vance of an open source on Twitter for cyber threat intelligence could be predicted through an automated feature-driven assess- ment of the source and utilized in different ways.<a name="bookmark51">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark52">&zwnj;</a>In particular, the time advantage of early cyber threat detection can be increased when using the quantiﬁed source relevance as a decisive factor for automated alert generation in existing systems. Especially for early threat intelligence which often lacks contextual information to be veriﬁed it can be beneﬁcial to take the publish- ing source into account and consider the intelligence relevant if the source has a suﬃciently high relevance score itself. This can reduce or even eliminate the need to wait for additional conﬁr- mation by other sources in many cases. During evaluation of the threat intelligence found in two years worth of Tweets from 172 cyber security-related users resulted that half of all alerts could have been issued at least 32 hours earlier without impairing the precision, meaning the time advantage of preventive cyber threat detection can be increased when using the quantiﬁed source rele- vance as a decisive factor for automated alert generation in existing systems.<a name="bookmark53">&zwnj;</a><a name="bookmark54">&zwnj;</a><a name="bookmark55">&zwnj;</a><a name="bookmark56">&zwnj;</a></p><p class="s27" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark66" class="s26" name="bookmark57">Besides an improved timeliness of threat intelligence, the source relevance can also lead to an increase in recall of the alert generation which means that more valid alerts (true posi- tives) can be generated from the collected data. Existing systems (</a><a href="#bookmark66" class="s17">Sapienza et al., </a>2018<a href="#bookmark95" class="s26">; </a><a href="#bookmark95" class="s17">Sapienza et al., </a>2017a<a href="#bookmark86" class="s26">; </a><a href="#bookmark86" class="s17">Mittal et al., </a>2016a<a href="#bookmark87" class="s26">; </a><a href="#bookmark87" class="s17">Mittal et al., </a>2019b<span style=" color: #000;">) wait until potential intelligence has been ob- served from multiple sources. This, however, prevents the gener- ation of alerts for highly speciﬁc threats that are only published by very few or even just one of the monitored sources. Thus, the score can also be used to select new sources that are relevant, that is, those that have a score above a certain threshold, and which are thereby likely to improve the system’s CTI collection.</span><a name="bookmark58">&zwnj;</a><a name="bookmark59">&zwnj;</a><a name="bookmark60">&zwnj;</a><a name="bookmark61">&zwnj;</a><a name="bookmark62">&zwnj;</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark63">&zwnj;</a>Several future research works could be conducted on the basis of the current model proposed, for example (i) by adapting and ap- plying the current model to other CTI Sources, thus studying its be- havior and associated performance in comparison to current “Twit- ter” CTI source, as well as (ii) conducting sensitivity analysis in or- der to understand how “sensitive” such model is when varying the initial data (i.e. dataset) and how predictions change depending on different features.<a name="bookmark64">&zwnj;</a><a name="bookmark65">&zwnj;</a></p><h1 style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Declaration of Competing Interest</h1><p style="padding-top: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;">The authors declare that they have no known competing ﬁnan- cial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to inﬂuence the work reported in this paper.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">CRediT authorship contribution statement</h1><p style="padding-top: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 113%;text-align: justify;">Andrea Tundis: <span class="p">Supervision, Writing – original draft, Method- ology, Validation, Formal analysis. </span>Samuel Ruppert: <span class="p">Software, Val- idation, Formal analysis, Methodology. </span>Max Mühlhäuser: <span class="p">Supervi- sion, Validation, Methodology, Formal analysis.</span></h1><p style="padding-top: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Acknowledgment</h1><p style="padding-top: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;"><a href="https://doi.org/10.13039/501100011821" class="s26" target="_blank">This research work was funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research and the Hessian </a><a href="https://doi.org/10.13039/501100011821" class="s17" target="_blank">Ministry of Higher Ed- ucation</a><a href="https://doi.org/10.13039/501100011821" class="s26" target="_blank">, Research, Science and the Arts within their joint </a>support of the National Research Center for Applied Cybersecurity ATHENE, as well as by the LOEWE initiative (Hesse, Germany) within the emergenCITY centre.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Supplementary material</h1><p style="padding-top: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s27" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: justify;"><a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cose.2021.102576" class="s26" target="_blank">Supplementary material associated with this article can be found, in the online version, at doi:</a>10.1016/j.cose.2021.102576<span style=" color: #000;">.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">References</h1><p style="padding-top: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s24" style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: -12pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;"><a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/cpe.3873" class="s23" target="_blank">Alrubaian, M., Al-Qurishi, M., Al-Rakhami, M., Hassan, M.M., Alamri, A., 2017.
