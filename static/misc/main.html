How do organizations stay in control of their attack surface despite their limited staff resources? Prior work has analyzed the overall software vulnerability ecosystem as well as patching processes within organizations, but not how these two are connected.</span></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">We investigate this missing link through semi-structured interviews with 22 organizations in critical infrastructure and government services. We analyze where in these organizations the responsibility is allocated to collect and triage information about software vulnerabilities, and find that none of our respondents is acquiring such information comprehensively, not even in a reduced and aggregated form like the National Vulnerability Database (NVD). This means that information on known vulnerabilities will be missed, even in critical infras- tructure organizations. We observe that organizations apply implicit and explicit coping mechanisms to reduce their intake of vulnerability information, and identify three trade-offs in these strategies: independence, pro-activeness and formaliza- tion.</p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">Although our respondents’ behavior is in conflict with the widely accepted security advice to collect comprehensive vul- nerability information about active systems, no respondents re- call having experienced a security incident that was associated with missing information on a known software vulnerability. This suggests that, given scarce resources, reducing the intake of vulnerability information by up to 95% can be consid- ered a rational strategy. Our findings raise questions about the allocation of responsibility and accountability for finding vulnerable systems, as well as suggest changing expectations around collecting vulnerability information.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ol id="l1"><li data-list-text="1."><h2 style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark0">&zwnj;</a>Introduction</h2><p style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark34" class="a">Contrary to popular belief, most attacks do not rely on advanced exploitation techniques or zero-days. Instead, they target known vulnerabilities which have been published months or sometimes years earlier </a><a href="#bookmark35" class="a">[1]. Delayed mitigation for known vulnerabilities can be disastrous, as many high profile breaches have demonstrated. Think of Equifax </a><a href="#bookmark36" class="a">[2], Maersk </a><a href="#bookmark37" class="a">[3] and, more recently, the victims of the Microsoft Exchange attacks </a><a href="#bookmark37">[4].</a></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark38" class="a">Against this backdrop, security experts urge organi- zations to mitigate the known vulnerabilities in their in- frastructure. Public vulnerability disclosures—e.g., via ven- dor announcements, security websites, or vulnerability databases—are the necessary first step for the vulnerability management process </a><a href="#bookmark39" class="a">[5]. Organizations might also discover vulnerabilities in their infrastructure in other ways, like pen testing and red teaming </a>[6], but these are complementary and not a replacement for a continuous process of acquiring and evaluating information on newly published vulnerabilities.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark40" class="a">The advice to mitigate known vulnerabilities sounds straightforward, until one takes the scale of the problem into account. The number of published vulnerabilities grows ev- ery year. For 2021, VulnDB reported over 29,000 vulnerabil- ities </a><a href="#bookmark41" class="a">[7]. Furthermore, information remains dispersed. While platforms like VulnDB aggregate published vulnerabilities, none of the platforms are complete or always timely </a><a href="#bookmark41">[8].</a></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">How do organizations cope with the flood of vulnera- bility information? In a year with at least 29,000 vulnera- bilities, just assessing if a vulnerability is at all relevant for their enterprise infrastructure would already require over 500 evaluations every week—an enormous undertaking. This does not include the more complicated follow-up tasks of identifying all instances of the vulnerability in their assets, assessing the risks associated with these vulnerabilities, the impact of mitigation on business operations, and the prioritization, testing and deployment of patches or other mitigations.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark41" class="a">Prior work has focused on the two different sides of this problem, rather than on how they are connected. On one side, there is a body of work that analyzes large aggregated vulnerability datasets </a><a href="#bookmark42" class="a">[8, </a><a href="#bookmark43" class="a">9, </a><a href="#bookmark44" class="a">10, </a><a href="#bookmark39" class="a">11]. It studies patterns in discovery, timing and exploitation of vulnerabilities, often with the aim to support patch prioritization, since scarce resources and business impacts prevent mitigating all known vulnerabilities. On the other side, there are studies on the vulnerability management process of enterprises </a><a href="#bookmark45" class="a">[6, </a><a href="#bookmark46" class="a">12, </a><a href="#bookmark47" class="a">13, </a><a href="#bookmark48" class="a">14, </a>15]. It looks at how system administrators acquire patch information, how they select which patches to deploy and how long it takes to deploy them.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">There is an important gap between these two areas: how comprehensive is the vulnerability information that organi- zations seek out compared to the total set of published vul-</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark45" class="a">nerabilities? Li et al. </a>[12] found that system administrators use various sources, such as vendor notifications, security advisories, blogs and forums. The authors concluded that we do not know how comprehensive or effective administrators are at acquiring the relevant information.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">We aim to fill this research gap with an empirical study of 22 organizations in critical infrastructures and govern- ment services, where missing relevant vulnerability infor- mation is potentially catastrophic. Via the national CERT in the Netherlands, we contacted and interviewed a recipient of CERT security advisories in each organization. We tran- scribed and coded the interviews on how their organizations deal with the conflict between limited staff time and staying informed about their attack surface.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">We first mapped where the organization allocated the task of acquiring vulnerability information. We then as- sessed what information sources the organization uses. The selected sources reflect large differences in the volume of vulnerabilities that the organizations are informed about, re- flecting different points along a ‘funnel’ from the total input of more than 25,000 vulnerabilities per year to the output of a much smaller and manageable set of vulnerabilities that are actually evaluated by staff—and what ‘manageable’ means depends on the size of the organization. After analyzing these results, we interviewed the same respondents again about the consequences that their organizations suffered, if any, for their limited intake of vulnerability information. We make the following contributions:</p><ul id="l2"><li data-list-text="•"><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: -9pt;text-align: justify;">We present an intuitive descriptive model of how or- ganizations reduce their intake of public vulnerability information via their selection of specific sources. The mix of sources reflects the volume that is manageable for them, even though this risks missing critical infor- mation about known vulnerabilities.</p></li><li data-list-text="•"><p style="padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: -9pt;text-align: justify;">We find that no organizations tried to acquire a compre- hensive view of the flood of published vulnerabilities and none even reported using an aggregator like the Na- tional Vulnerability Database (NVD) or its commercial alternatives. Instead they implicitly or explicitly relied on curation by trusted authoritative sources to filter their vulnerability information. Prime examples are CERT security advisories, vendor notifications, security websites and vulnerability scanning solutions.</p></li><li data-list-text="•"><p style="padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: -9pt;text-align: justify;">We identify three trade-offs underlying the coping strategies of organizations: conducting independent as- sessments vs. trusting authoritative sources, acquiring information proactively vs. reactively, and relying on formalized vs. ad hoc organizational processes. There exists a relationship between the size of the organiza- tion and strategy chosen with these trade-offs, namely that larger organizations tend to be less dependent on trusting others, more proactive and more formalized.</p></li><li data-list-text="•"><p style="padding-left: 26pt;text-indent: -9pt;text-align: justify;">While the coping strategies dramatically reduce the in- take of information, sometimes up to 95%, respondents expressed little concern for missing relevant vulnera- bilities. This attitude is facilitated by the fact that no respondent could remember a security incident associ- ated with missed vulnerability information.</p></li></ul></li><li data-list-text="2."><h2 style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1">&zwnj;</a>Related Work</h2><p style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark49" class="a">Public vulnerability disclosures are one step in an or- ganization’s vulnerability discovery process. There is an area of research related to the overall ecosystem of pub- lished vulnerabilities, e.g., around the NVD </a><a href="#bookmark50" class="a">[16]. These studies analyze how to assess and prioritize vulnerabilities through the use of metrics and models. Notably, the CVSS metric </a><a href="#bookmark51" class="a">[17] is often used to support decision making in filtering out the most critical software vulnerabilities, but according to its developers CVSS is actually unfit for this purpose </a><a href="#bookmark52" class="a">[18]. Researchers have been critical of if such metrics accurately model risk. Allodi and Massacci </a><a href="#bookmark53" class="a">[19] conducted an empirical study and found that using the commonly used CVSSv2 score to prioritize vulnerabilities was no better than doing it randomly. Spring et al. </a><a href="#bookmark54" class="a">[20] stated that users of CVSSv3 are likely not learning from it what they are thinking they are learning from it: the score does not indicate risk but rather shows severity. The authors pose that the CVSSv3 formula has not been sufficiently justified, nor has it been empirically validated. They illustrate the CVSS metric is in practice “widely misused” for direct vulnerability prioritization instead of being one instrument among multiple inputs. This is congruent with a user study of CVSSv3 which found that scores are not consistently calculated, showing little difference in performance between the experts and laypersons </a><a href="#bookmark55" class="a">[21]. Building on these critiques, authors have proposed to improve vulnerability prioritization by introducing new factors to the models </a><a href="#bookmark56" class="a">[22, </a><a href="#bookmark57" class="a">23, </a><a href="#bookmark53" class="a">24], by developing alternative decision-making models </a><a href="#bookmark58" class="a">[20] and by applying machine-learning to try to predict when a vul- nerability will be exploited </a><a href="#bookmark59" class="a">[25, </a>26]. However, metrics and models are just one side of the story.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark45" class="a">There is a weak relationship between vulnerability in- formation being made available and patching actually taking place. Research on organizational factors helps explain when and why remediation does take place. For example, from interviews with sysadmins, Li et al. </a><a href="#bookmark60" class="a">[12] found compliance with organizational policies to be an important factor in when a patch is deployed. The authors discuss in depth the process by which sysadmins deploy updates, showing that they often used a staggered deployment model (i.e., sep- arating development and production environments) which trades off timeliness for reliability. These authors further note that “[vulnerability] information is highly dispersed” and that “it is possible that some system administrators may lack the full coverage of relevant information”, suggesting that this is “a nontrivial task for many”. A similar example of organizational factors shaping outcomes is the study of Bouwman et al. </a><a href="#bookmark39" class="a">[27] who found that when selecting sources of threat intelligence, organizations were not optimizing for network detection, as one might expect, but rather for their analysts’ workflow by minimizing false positives. Alomar et al. </a>[6] interviewed 53 security professionals and describe organizational factors in outsourcing detection within the vulnerability discovery process. They found that organi- zations that don’t prioritize security often have a reactive stance towards detection of vulnerabilities. Building on this</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">study, we include public sources and third parties as crucial ways in how organizations learn about disclosed vulnera- bilities and assess their relevance, and focus on tensions in organizational processes.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">In short, research has highlighted the need of using a wide variety of sources in order to ensure coverage of vul- nerabilities, but does not detail how this happens in practice nor at what scale. So prior work has not established how the two areas – the vulnerability ecosystem and vulnerability remediation by organizations – are connected to each other.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li data-list-text="3."><h2 style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark2">&zwnj;</a>Methodology<a name="bookmark6">&zwnj;</a></h2><p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">We conducted two rounds of semi-structured interviews to study how organizations deal with the large volume of published vulnerabilities. Our study was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of Delft University of Technology. Respondents were explained in detail about the study, associated risks, use of information for which they provided informed consent. The conversations focused on public vulnerability discovery and triage.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ol id="l3"><li data-list-text="3.1."><h3 style="padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: -22pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark3">&zwnj;</a>Participant Selection</h3><p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark10" class="a">In collaboration with the national CERT, we approached 29 organizations in critical infrastructure sectors and central government that receive the CERT’s official security advi- sories. As seen in Table </a>1, we contacted both large and small organizations. Organizations were emailed about the study via the email address that they have designated for receiving security advisories. We asked for one respondent who is responsible for receiving and processing security advisories and other vulnerability information. Two weeks after the first invitation to participate, we sent a reminder. If organizations did not reply after the reminder e-mail, they were contacted by phone.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">In total, we conducted interviews in 24 organizations. However, 2 participants did not consent to having their interview data transcribed for analysis. We could therefore not include these interviews in our analysis, but the infor- mation we received in those interviews is consistent with the patterns we identified in the remaining interviews. So our analysis is based on 22 organizations, which means our invitation had a response rate of 76%. We interviewed respondents in 14 central government organizations and 8 organizations from critical infrastructure sectors, such as drinking water supply, energy, and finance.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li data-list-text="3.2."><h3 style="padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: -22pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark4">&zwnj;</a>Interview Protocol</h3><p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">We conducted four pilot interviews to validate the inter- view protocol and process. These interviews were not used in the data analysis. On the basis of these interviews, the protocol was refined. From May until June 2020, we con- ducted semi-structured interviews with professionals in the contacted organizations who were receiving and processing security advisories. The interviews were conducted in person</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">or via video conferencing applications, lasting between 50 to 75 minutes each. Respondents were volunteers and were not compensated for the interview.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark38" class="a">Since we recruited participants who receive National CERT security advisories, we used these advisories as a starting point for eliciting information about the organiza- tional work flow around seeking and receiving vulnerability information. Analyzing the role of public information in the vulnerability discovery and triage process, the interview protocol focused on two topics: the inflow of public vulner- ability information (acquisition), and processing, prioritiz- ing, and reviewing vulnerability information from different sources (triage) </a>[5]. Participants were asked to complete a short post-interview questionnaire, about their role, years of experience as a practitioner within the organization, as well as demographic questions about the size of their organiza- tion, size of their incident response team, and sector.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark77" class="a">After a preliminary analysis of the results from these interviews, we found that no organization was ingesting anywhere close to comprehensive vulnerability information. This finding was troubling and raised follow-up questions. Did the organizations consciously design their limited intake of information? Did they ever suffer consequences for miss- ing vulnerability information? To answer these questions, we conducted brief follow-up interviews in February 2022. Of the 22 original respondents, 16 agreed to participate in the second round. The respondents received a summary of our preliminary findings and were then asked additional questions on source selection, incidents based on missed information, and evaluation of their selected sources. All interview questions are included in Appendices </a><a href="#bookmark78" class="a">B and </a><a href="#bookmark78">C.</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li data-list-text="3.3."><h3 style="padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: -22pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark5">&zwnj;</a>Interview Coding</h3><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark61" class="a">Data collection and transcription was done by the two lead researchers in collaboration with two other researchers.

Where do organizations allocate the responsibility to receive and process this information? We find that there is a large variety among organizations. Various professionals, ranging from analysts, system admin- istrators, to management, are assigned the task to deal with vulnerability information. Organizations need to handle this according to the means and staff available.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark10" class="a">While some of our respondents work in organizations with thousands of employees and large incident response teams, there are organizations in critical sectors with less than 500 employees, relatively small IT departments and even smaller incident response teams. The overview in table </a>1 illustrates that there is great variance in the make-up of these organizations.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark10" class="a">Table </a>1 provides an overview of the organizations. They are very different in terms of total size (FTE). We inter- viewed 6 respondents from large organizations with more than 5000 employees, 8 respondents in medium-sized orga- nizations with 501-5000 employees, as well as 8 respondents employed in smaller organizations with 1-500 employees. Respondents worked in different areas, some are specialized, such as Security Operations Centers (SOC). Other respon- dents worked in security or IT-security departments or in general IT departments. Finally, several interviewees worked in business operations.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark11" class="a">Table </a>2 provides an overview of security advisories</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">are part of organizations with larger resources to process vulnerability information.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">Interviewees in three organizations had dual roles within the organization; specifically all dual roles were employees who combined the work of security officer with that of system administrator. Whereas the total organization size is diverse, the IR teams were all small. As opposed to the formalized division of roles at SOCs, the dual roles have a much less formalized position. These roles both receive information and are responsible for assessing and the remediation of possible vulnerabilities, fulfilling tasks other organizations employ several people for in various roles.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">Important to note is the unequal distribution of capacity to monitor vulnerability information. On the one hand there are large teams with specialized analyst roles who are able to monitor different sources full time. On the other hand, there are individuals who have this role part time, aside from other, non-security tasks. Furthermore, it provides informa- tion on where responsibilities for processing and evaluating vulnerability disclosures lie. Where one organization has a team to assess information, others are solely responsible for this task. But the stakes for each of these organizations are the same; they are all important with respect to critical infrastructure services and national security.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li data-list-text="5."><h2 style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark8">&zwnj;</a>Sources of Information<a name="bookmark9">&zwnj;</a></h2><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark12" class="a">How do organizations learn about public vulnerability disclosures?

The sources that the respondents mentioned all imply a lot of information has already been left out before it is even considered by the organization. On average, respondents mentioned they use 4 sources, but the variance is significant: 4 respondents mentioning using only 2 sources, while one respondent mentions 7. The list is largely in line with the findings of Li et al. </a>[12], who interviewed only system administrators. We will discuss the four most prevalent sources and relate these to the characteristics of the organizations.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">Security advisories <a href="#bookmark10" class="a">are received by all respondents, which reflects that their organizations were selected on the basis of them receiving National CERT security advisories. The advisories represent a heavily filtered set of vulnerabili- ties. The National CERT sends around 1200 advisories each year for vulnerabilities that it has selected after a risk as- sessment of likelihood and impact. This volume constitutes less than 5% of the total number of published vulnerabilities in 2021. Interviewed organizations can opt to receive only specific CERT advisories based on their IT assets. As shown in Table </a><span class="p">1, 12 of these 22 organizations have chosen to receive only a subset of these advisories. We did not find clear indicators for why organizations choose to receive a subset or not.</span></h4><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">Relying on the advisories of the National CERT reduces the amount of security advisories recipients must process every week, but it also indicates a higher degree of trust in a third party to pre-select advisories that are important to the recipient. For organizations mainly relying on the CERT advisories, this implies a filtering out of over 95% of all vulnerability information that is never received, let alone evaluated for relevance.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;"><b>Vendor notifications </b>are the second most frequently mentioned source. They are typically made up of periodic lists with vulnerabilities sent by software and hardware suppliers. For vulnerabilities that are deemed more critical by the vendor, organizations receive a notification and a pos- sible path of action. One respondent described the outreach of vendors (13): <i>We have a fair amount of vendors who share information whenever there is a vulnerability. So I’d also consider that a source. </i>The time between lists differs per vendor. Some send out weekly notifications, while others send out a list each month.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">In some cases, respondents directly communicate with the vendor on a specific notification. Organizations value the additional information vendors can provide on a specific product and the speed of the notifications, but they are rarely seen as a full replacement for security advisories. Moreover, many vendors or open source projects have no direct channel to the users or admins of their products, so they rely on public channels to reach their user base. This means direct vendor notifications will only provide organizations with a fraction of all vulnerability disclosures.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;"><b>Open source security websites </b>are frequently used by many respondents, varying from national, international secu- rity news, as well as expert blogs or fora. Said respondents 20: <i>Yeah so these are mainly technical news sites: [...] Hackernews, Securityfocus, Threatpost, Collegeblog, Open- sourcesecurity.</i>. Social Media were mentioned to a lesser extent: <i>Within our team we’re active on Reddit to keep up with things... Different security Twitter accounts and so on. Often it’s issues that are posted within the community. Then we know when something starts popping up around a specific product that we have to keep our eyes and ears open</i>(13).</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">Eight respondents relied solely on monitoring websites in combination with security advisories and, sometimes, vendor notifications. These organizations all have a total size of fewer than than 500 employees and incident response teams of less than 10 people. This could indicate that the choice to rely on these two or three types of sources is driven on the limited capacity and resources of the organization. The amount of vulnerabilities covered varies per website, but these tend to be vulnerabilities which are more newsworthy and are unlikely to contain more than a few vulnerabilities per day. This means that organizations learn about less than 5% of all published vulnerabilities via this channel – and a significant portion of this set is likely to overlap with the security advisories. Overall, these practices imply a large amount of trust in the third parties behind these sources, assuming that they will report on all relevant vulnerabilities for an organization.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;"><b>Vulnerability scanning services </b>like those offered by Qualys and Rapid7 Nexpose automate the process of identi- fying what vulnerabilities are present in organizations. Nine organizations use vulnerability scanners in-house and two have outsourced scanning to external SOCs that monitor vul- nerabilities for them. All respondents that use vulnerability scanners employ at least 500 people. Also in this category, we see the use of a number of other automated types of sources such as external SOCs that supply the organization with vulnerability notifications. In a large enterprise envi- ronment, these services can scan for thousands of different vulnerabilities and their often voluminous results basically represent the intake of a large amount of vulnerability information – in fact, the largest amount of all sources mentioned by the organizations. That said, there is still a significant degree of trust implied by relying on these service providers, since the organizations assume that the services capture all relevant vulnerabilities. As respondent 11 put it: <i>Nexpose automates this [vulnerability scanning]. At six o’clock it receives an update and if there is a CVE-score of 8 or higher then it scans for the vulnerability directly, once per day. Some zones are scanned broadly, others are scanned once per day</i>. It is not transparent how comprehensive these scanners are but it is virtually impossible for them to be complete, as not all vulnerabilities can be scanned for automatically. Plus, some vulnerabilities are associated with protocols that are not supported by the scanners or the net- works that they are deployed in. Organizations do not appear to have any sense of how comprehensive these services are, nor do they seem to worry relevant vulnerabilities—which reflects an implicit trust in the providers of these services.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">Threat intelligence platforms <a href="#bookmark60" class="a">(TIP) provide an inter- face to commercial feeds of information about adversary behavior, as well as open source blocklists </a><span class="p">[27]. These sources are not focused on vulnerability information directly, but reporting on adversary behavior informs the recipient which vulnerabilities are currently being targeted by attack- ers. Four organizations indicated that they made use of threat intelligence as a service, receiving e-mail notifications or periodic overviews. Two of these respondents have access to automated tooling. These are also part of teams with at least 25 people. The other two had a much smaller capacity and use vendor notifications and open source websites, in addition to the information managed by Managed Security Service Providers (MSSPs).</span></h4><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">Even for a medium-sized enterprise, TIP services can lead to hundreds of notifications in their mailbox. Said re- spondents 19: <i>On average each day I receive maybe 20 or 30 notifications by mail? Maybe I’m forgetting some, because not all of them are important</i><a href="#bookmark64" class="a">. How organizations choose to manage threat intel information matters. On the one hand, opting for paid services to curate and filter relevant infor- mation quickly diminishes the amount of information that needs to be assessed. On the other hand, monitoring events can quickly increase the amount of notifications to assess. In the end, only a very small fraction of vulnerabilities are observed to be attacked in the wild </a><a href="#bookmark65" class="a">[31, </a>32], and only these vulnerabilities would show up in threat intelligence.</p></li><li data-list-text="6."><h2 style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark13">&zwnj;</a>Coping Strategies</h2><p style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">The different sources reflect varying degrees of compre- hensiveness in terms of vulnerability information. As noted above, no organization is trying to comprehensively track this information, not even in the reduced format of aggre- gation platforms like VulnDB or NVD. Every organization has to some degree reduced their intake of vulnerability information, even though this implies accepting the risk that they miss learning about vulnerabilities that could be present in their infrastructure. This is basically a coping strategy that seeks to balance the need to learn about known vulnerabilities without overwhelming the organization by more information then it can process and evaluate.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark23" class="a">From our coding of the interviews, we identified three interrelated trade-offs that shape the coping strategies of organizations and, thus, the degree of comprehensiveness of the vulnerability information that they acquire and further triage towards actual mitigation and patching actions. The overview provided in Table </a>4 illustrates key elements linked to each trade-off, followed by the main codes with which we labeled the interviews. The trade-offs are sliding scales rather than dichotomies. The first trade-off is between trust- ing authorities and third parties to select relevant vulnerabil- ity information versus independently seeking and evaluating vulnerability information. The second trade-off is between proactive monitoring of public vulnerability disclosures to enable curation and assessment of information versus re- active responses upon receiving vulnerability information sent by outside parties. Third, we see a trade-offs between adopting highly formalized processes with automated tools to acquire, structure and prioritize information versus ad hoc processes that rely more on people and manual labor to acquire and evaluate information in their triage process.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ol id="l5"><li data-list-text="6.1."><h3 style="padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: -22pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark14">&zwnj;</a>Independence Versus Trust</h3><p style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">The first strategy considers to what extent organizations rely on others to learn about new vulnerabilities – in other words, trust placed in third parties.</p><ol id="l6"><li data-list-text="6.1.1."><h4 style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark15">&zwnj;</a>Independent from Others. <a href="#bookmark23" class="a">Independence increases if organizations source and assess a multitude of sources and cross-references them to formulate risks. For instance, by not relying on one source, but by collecting sector- specific advisories, national and international advisories and comparing them. As shown in Table </a><span class="p">4, independence means relying less on national authorities or third parties for risk assessments, and being able to process information and make assessments about vulnerability information in-house. One organization used various information sources to cre- ate its own security advisories, tailored to the needs of its IT-infrastructure. As a respondent explained: </span><i>You have to make your own judgement [...] That is why you need checks and balances, what is said internationally about this vulnerability? Then we look at communities, friends and acquaintances we trust very highly. How did you assess that [vulnerability]? (2)</i></h4></li><li data-list-text="6.1.2."><h4 style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark16">&zwnj;</a>Trusting other parties. <span class="p">Organizations that have a high degree of trust in other parties, rely more on these parties to provide and assess vulnerability information. This is seen in how some organizations are likely to adopt assessments by authoritative peers and third parties, or outsource (parts) of its vulnerability management capabil- ity altogether. Organizations with a high degree of trust outsource selecting—i.e., filtering out—vulnerability infor- mation. This happens through authoritative peers such as national CERTS, but also vendors play a key role. As seen in 11 organizations, outsourcing the supply of vulnerability information is in some cases necessary. The organization does not have the capacity to organize and process the complete information stream, making them dependent on external capacity for monitoring vulnerabilities.</span></h4><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">The national CERT adds a risk assessment to their security advisories. They evaluate whether the risk is “low”, “medium”, or “high” along two dimensions: the likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited; and the potential im- pact when the vulnerability is exploited. Especially the risk scores given by trusted third parties are appreciated by these organizations, as it allows security teams to better advocate for mitigating measures within the organization. One respon- dent stated that the risk score from the national CERT deter- mined further handling: <i>When the National CERT says that a vulnerability medium/high [impact/likelihood] and we base further steps on that. So that’s leading. Sometimes we have questions, like: How did you come to that medium/high? Then you have interesting conversations on the topic – but the national CERT is leading </i>(17). Security advisories sent by national CERTS play a role in creating urgency: <i>Alarm bells go off when its a High/High </i><a href="#bookmark23" class="a">(18). In Table </a>4, key codes for trusting organizations center around reliance on external stakeholders for triage.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">In sum, the coping strategies of organizations are dis- tributed along this scale going from independence to trust. Organizations that are highly trusting on third parties tend to rely more heavily on CERT advisories as their main source of information, even though these filter out at least 95% of the published vulnerabilities. Particularly smaller organizations tend to be higher on trust. This pre-selection done by the National CERT is meant as an aid, but not replacement of independent evaluation of information.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark9" class="a">At the other side we see mostly large organizations that make more independent evaluations based on scanning service outcomes </a>(section 5). Their vulnerability information is more comprehensive with more automatic triage.

A proactive approach means organizations determine whether publicly disclosed vulnerabilities are applicable to their organiza- tion </a>[5]. Respondents periodically scan network segments to determine risks. Medium, severe and critical vulnerabil- ities are given a deadline to resolve, whilst low ones are registered but are remediated in normal patch cycles. Said a respondent working in a medium-sized organization cross- references sources: <i>A vulnerability scanner just monitors the CVE list.

Technical information of possible exploits are struc- turally gathered by (specialized) team members. Essential information is extracted from third party notifications and incorporated in these self-created bundles, combined with information of their respective environments and/or prod- ucts. This is then sent to stakeholders within the organi- zation.

Such a process is not a continuous process, but dependent on outside triggers with codes shown in Table </a>4. As an example, advisories on critical vulnerabilities set in motion processes to assess and then resolve the vulnerability. An interviewee stated: <i>We receive a call [from the National CERT] when it’s a High/High advisory [impact/likelihood]. So we have a big incentive if it’s really critical [...] Once I see a High/High, I drop all other work and I’ll first determine the impact specifically for our organization </i>(20).</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">Of the 22 organizations, 6 had security teams with five or fewer members. These organizations mentioned reactive strategies. None of them employ scanners or another form of automated vulnerability tooling. All sources of vulnerability information, most importantly advisories from suppliers and CERTs, are received by mail. The security teams focus on processing these advisories and possibly check information through open source news sites before advising system administrator teams and management on possible actions.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">Instead of processing IoCs, reactive organizations rely on third parties such as vendors and government agencies like CERTs to deliver vulnerability information to their teams.

Some organizations prefer to formalize their processes and develop tools to structure information flows about vulnera- bilities. Other organizations prefer organic, ad hoc processes where professionals manually curate information flows and often use personal communication to manage vulnerabilities. This trade-off is closely related to proactive and reactive approaches, but not exactly the same. An informal process managed by a professional can still be proactive, but this is more difficult, since it doesn’t scale. Large information flows are more likely to overwhelm the capacity of a small number of professionals working organically.</p><ol id="l8"><li data-list-text="6.3.1."><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark21">&zwnj;</a><b>Formalized Processes. </b><a href="#bookmark23" class="a">Organizations that formalize processes have a clear division of roles and tasks. They use and develop tools to structure information flows. Table </a>4 shows codes from the interviews such as formalized process and separation of roles to describe this strategy. An inter- viewee stated that: <i>We differentiate between handler groups. I have the coordinating role for handler group privacy and security. So I monitor if things are prioritized enough and if it runs smoothly </i>(22).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">Another code associated with formalization is “high capacity because of automation”. Formal structures are sup- ported through the use of tools. One clear example which is widespread is the use of ticketing systems where notifi- cations are loaded into, preferably in automated way. These systems are intimately connected to the formalized process of handling vulnerability information. Critical vulnerabilities are given the high priority label. This tooling might be actively developed. Several organizations mentioned having DevOps capabilities in their IR team. As one respondent from a medium-sized organizations shared: <i>In principle, we have three teams within our small team. We have the engineering team, which me and another colleague are a part of. We’re mainly preoccupied with automation, so that we decrease repetition of labor. We have the security monitoring team to bring that to a higher level. And we have the tooling team which is preoccupied with technical and functional maintenance of our tools, and life-cycle management if needed. </i>(8)</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">One more indicator of formalization is that vulnerability advisories are received in functional mailboxes instead of personal mailboxes. This then requires a process to make sure that the mailbox is regularly reviewed and information is not missed. As one respondent put it (8): <i>The mailbox is monitored daily. Everyday we assign a man of the day</i>. Sharing information inside and outside the organization is also automated. Two respondents had structured and au- tomated processes to gather relevant information for their infrastructure and spread it to stakeholders within their organization, such as the respective system administrators. A respondent working in the SOC of a large organization describes how they define use cases with specific key words and aggregate them from a variety of public sources.</p></li><li data-list-text="6.3.2."><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: -27pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark22">&zwnj;</a><b>Ad hoc Processes. </b><a href="#bookmark23" class="a">Organizations which have ad hoc processes in their vulnerability triage use personal com- munication and manually curate information flows.

Individuals often have multiple roles within the triage process, particularly in teams with fewer than five FTE. Said respondent 10: <i>I’m an Information Security Officer, as we call it here. Next to my role as system administrator. Because of this, I am the primary person preoccupied with the vulnerabilities I see in [Windows Defender] ATP</i>. They are security practition- ers responsible for monitoring vulnerability information, as well as system administrators responsible for patching the vulnerability.

Each of them has adopted a certain mix of sources that reflect underlying trade- offs around trust, proactivity, and formalization. Different sources represent different orders of magnitude in terms of the number of vulnerabilities the organization learns about. We can visualize these sources, and the coping strategies that they are a part of, as points along a funnel (Figure </a><a href="#bookmark41" class="a">1). The input of the funnel is the total pool of newly published vulnerabilities. In 2021, this contained at a very minimum over 29,000 vulnerabilities—given that VulnDB, like all aggregators, is not complete </a>[8]. The output of the funnel</p><p class="s8" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark26">&zwnj;</a>Figure 1. The ‘funnel’ of vulnerability information, a descriptive model of coping strategies where organizations restrict the yearly volume of vulnerability information they acquire through the selection of sources.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">On the left side, we find the closest approximation of the total set of published vulnerabilities: the aggregators like VulnDB, NVD, etc. They capture information on tens of thousands of vulnerabilities. Next, we find the vulnerability scanning services. Rather than acquiring and processing comprehensive vulnerability information themselves, orga- nizations rely on the providers of these services to do so. Organizations take the results from the scans as the vulnerabilities they need to triage. It is not clear to how comprehensive these services are, but respondents reported learning about thousands of vulnerabilities from running these tools across their infrastructure.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">One further step to the right, we find sources like threat intelligence and vulnerability monitoring by MSSPs and external SOCs. These focus more on vulnerabilities that might be targeted by adversaries and that the client thus needs to learn about. They are less comprehensive than</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">dedicated vulnerability scanning services that aim to find vulnerabilities across the whole infrastructure. The next step down the ‘funnel’ brings us to sources like security websites and blogs. This was reported to result in a few vulnerabilities per day at most. Finally, the smallest source that most organizations used were the vendor notifications. This quantity is of course highly dependent on the type of vendor and the number of vendors, but few vendors report new vulnerabilities more than a few times per month.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: right;">All organizations reported using multiple sources along- side security advisories, between 2 and 7. Their overall intake of vulnerability information is driven by the largest source that they use. So for the 9 organizations that reported using scanning services, the funnel is rather short and much less narrow than for 11 organizations whose largest source is the CERT advisories. The longer the funnel, the more information about known vulnerabilities has been filtered out along the way. An organization that relies primarily on security advisories and vendor notifications will only learn about just a few percent of newly published vulnerabilities. We approximated the intake of organizations by asking how many vulnerability messages the organization receive. Some respondents mentioned between 5 and 10 messages a day from various sources. They complement the advisory source with vulnerability information from vendors once or twice a month. Other organizations reported receiving more</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: justify;">than a 100 messages each day.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">The position along the funnel reflects the three trade- offs that we discussed in the previous section. The more to the right, the more trust the organization – implicitly or explicitly – places in the entities that provide this source. The unspoken assumption is that the entity is responsible for identifying the relevant new vulnerabilities for the or- ganization. Some respondents explicitly stated that this is what they expect from the national CERT, even though the CERT does not intend its advisories to be used in that way. It does not claim to identify all relevant new vulnerabilities and sees the recipient as ultimately responsible for acquiring this information. A position to the left of the funnel is also associated with more proactive collection of information and with more formalized processes, while to the right we find more reactive strategies and ad hoc processes.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark24" class="a">We find a clear relationship between the size of the organization and the size of the sources. Table </a>5 shows orga- nizations categorized by size (large, medium and small) and by the largest source of vulnerability information that they reported using. The separation between large to medium organizations on the one hand and small organizations on the other hand, is clear. Larger organizations ingest an order of magnitude more vulnerability information than small organizations. They use in-house or outsourced monitoring capabilities, while small organizations rely more on security advisories and open source security websites as information sources, processing lower amounts of vulnerabilities. This relationship between size and sources suggests that organi- zations reduce the intake of information to not overwhelm their capacity, rather than developing the capacity needed to process information about new vulnerabilities.</p></li><li data-list-text="8."><h2 style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark27">&zwnj;</a>Revisiting Intake Strategies<a name="bookmark28">&zwnj;</a></h2><p style="padding-top: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark45" class="a">From our first round of interviews, a set of practices emerged that stand in contrast to the assumption of many experts that organizations need to comprehensively acquire vulnerability information in order to remedy known vul- nerabilities </a><a href="#bookmark66" class="a">[12]. Where best practice according to CISA is that organizations should match sources of vulnerability information with their assets, so each unique asset has a dedicated list </a><a href="#bookmark67" class="a">[33], NIST emphasizes the importance of comprehensive sources to assess the risk of vulnerabilities to the organization </a><a href="#bookmark68" class="a">[34] and industry vulnerability management models focus on automating and standardizing intake of information </a><a href="#bookmark69" class="a">[35, </a>36]. But crudely put: none of our respon- dents’ organizations acquired even close to comprehensive information. Organizations with fewer people and tools to process sources of information, choose to more severely limit their information intake. One such coping strategy is to rely fully on vulnerabilities categorized as critical by trusted external parties in security advisories. Respondent 3 explained: <i>If they [the national CERT] call me outside of office hours about a Windows patch, I know that they have rated the vulnerability as ‘critical’ and that I should better respond adequately and make time in my schedule to apply it soon</i>.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">These best practices raises two follow-up questions. First, are the organizations conscious about how much in- formation they are missing? Have they deliberately chosen and evaluated their set of sources or has this set organically grown over time? Second, did they ever experience an incident associated with a known vulnerability that they were not informed about? In other words, did they suffer negative consequences for reducing, sometimes drastically, their intake of information?</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">To collect answers to these questions, we contacted the same 22 respondents again for a short second interview. We were able to speak with 16 of them (73%). We asked them <i>i) </i>whether their set of sources was the outcome of a formal process or whether it grew organically over time, <i>ii) </i>if they had the idea they were missing relevant vulnerability information, and <i>iii) </i><a href="#bookmark78" class="a">if they had ever suffered an incident around a vulnerability they were not informed about. If yes, we asked if this caused changes in their set of information sources. If no, then we asked if there had been any changes to these sources in the past two years and, if so, for what reasons (the protocol is included in Appendix </a><a href="#bookmark78">C).</a></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">Four respondents (25%) reported having a formal proce- dure for periodically evaluating their vulnerability notifica- tion sources in terms of relevancy. Most organizations said the sources had grown organically. For example, when a product is purchased from a new vendor, this often includes receiving vulnerability information on that product as a service. This source is then incorporated in the process. In the words of one interviewee: <i>To be completely fair, we consist of a limited number of network and system administrators. When you mention [sources], you’ll notice it is not a conscious decision. </i>(12)</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">When asked if sources were added as a deliberate choice, respondents mention two types of sources that were added as a deliberate decision to their sources: threat intelligence services and vulnerability scanning services. Because these tools require a paid subscription, capacity and resources to effectively incorporate in the existing processes, the choice to add them to their sources, organizations use a review process to see which service best fits their needs. Vulnerability scanners require a degree of formalization of the vulnerability information intake process, because of the volume of information they produce, which requires the organization to free up capacity. The deliberate choices for these services is opposed to vulnerability information a vendor provides when purchasing a product or service, since this information is generally sent in the form of an e-mail, the information can easily be incorporated in the existing process without changes. As respondent 16 put it: <i>Sources come and sources go. The only processes that we formally arranged are the National CERT advisories and the scans we conduct.</i></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">Surprisingly, ten of our respondents were confident that through their current sources, they were not missing relevant vulnerability information. They expressed being satisfied with their selection of sources. As one respondent stated: <i>I don’t think we have [missed vulnerability information]. Until now we never had an incident that made us question our scope </i>(13). Of the respondents who felt less confident, two stated that they were positive that they had missed vulnerability information. The other four respondents stated various reasons why they felt they missed vulnerability in- formation. Two respondents worried less about the offering but more about the timeliness of information they receive. They would like to receive vulnerability information before it is made public. One respondent said: <i>“I don’t think anyone can claim to not miss anything. As I said earlier, we have a lot of products and some we don’t even know we have. The Log4J case showed clearly, you can have an overview of what you have but tomorrow you discover you miss a lot.” </i>(16)</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">The satisfaction with the existing, limited intake of information seems directly related to their answer to the next question: did they ever suffer an incident that was associated with missing vulnerability information? Of 16 respondents,</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">12 (75%) said they could not recall any incident. Three organizations (19%) said they assumed this might have hap- pened at some point, but they could not actually remember a specific incident.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">Only a single respondent answered they did recall an ‘incident’. When pressed for more details, it turned out that this was a situation where they had not received a security advisory from the National CERT for a vulnerability that was relevant to them, because the organization had not correctly registered a specific asset with the CERT and thus was not receiving advisories pertaining to said asset. This missed advisory did not lead to an actual breach of the asset. The respondent characterized it as a failure of information acquisition, not a security breach.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Interestingly, the three organizations that assumed they</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark26" class="a">probably did miss vulnerability information are all large organizations. They have a relatively high capacity and are processing multiple sources of information – i.e., they are on the left side of our model (Figure </a>1). The organization that provided the example of a missed vulnerability (which they called an “incident”) is a small organization relying mostly on CERT advisories. This suggests a paradox: increased capacity makes organizations more aware of how much vulnerability information is available and, thus, how likely it is that information will be missed.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: right;">In sum, no respondent could indicate an incident – in the sense of a security breach – associated with missing vulnerability information. We complemented this finding by asking staff at the National CERT, the sender of security advisories, if they could remember any instance of a breach occurring at an organization related to a vulnerability that the organization had not acquired the information for. They could recall no such instance, while indicating that an incident of this nature would have been very memorable. This means that the organizations experienced no down- side or penalty for their limited vulnerability information intake. In the absence of negative feedback from their threat environment, they had no reason to question their coping strategies and limited intake, even though it was mostly driven by their organizational limitations. The limitations in capacity reflect underlying resource allocation decisions, so they are not random, but they are also not the result of formal risk evaluation. Rather they reflect an organic process of trial and error, where the ‘error’, namely a breach, has not (yet) materialized, as far as they know. Hence, organizations stick with the trial; their initial allocation of (very) limited resources to acquire and process vulnerability information. When asked if they had changed their sources over the last two years, the majority of respondents focused on the automation of current sources and adding threat intelligence sources, mainly a threat intelligence service provided by the National CERT. Only two respondents stated they had not changed their sources the last two years. Also, only three respondents, all large organizations, described that changes to their sources were part of a structured periodic evaluation. For 12 respondents (75%) the review and changed of sources is not a structured activity but often instigated by external events, such as the new threat intelligence service from the National CERT, or incidents. As one respondent stated: <i>Changes in our sources are limited. We tried to create an extra source of information by better structuring our threat intelligence. </i>(9) For two organizations, their changed sources were a result of a new contract for their outsourced SOC services. One respondent was triggered by the question to perform a review, and two others reported that incidents</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">at other organizations prompted them to do this.</p></li><li data-list-text="9."><h2 style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark29">&zwnj;</a>Discussion</h2><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">How do organizations deal with the conflict between limited staff time and staying informed about their known vulnerabilities in their attack surface? Of the 22 organi- zations we interviewed in critical infrastructures and gov-</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">ernment, not a single one acquired aggregated information via services like NVD or VulnDB, let alone attempt to collect even more comprehensive information. In short, no one drinks from the firehose of <i>all </i>published vulnerability disclosures.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark45" class="a">The sources of vulnerability information that the partic- ipating organizations reported are in line with Li et al. </a>[12]. This prior work did not assess the impact of these sources on the comprehensiveness of the vulnerability information that organizations acquire. We tried to fill this missing gap and contextualized these sources as part of coping strategies to reduce the intake of vulnerability information, in some cases by more than 95%.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><ol id="l9"><li data-list-text="9.1."><h3 style="padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: -22pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark30">&zwnj;</a>Coping Strategies</h3><p style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">The coping strategies reflect organizational constraints. We found that smaller organizations, with smaller IT de- partments and incident response teams, reduce their intake of vulnerability information much more dramatically than large organizations, who can process the results of auto- mated vulnerability scanning services, covering thousands of new vulnerabilities each year. The coping strategies place varying degrees of trust in the authorities and third parties that provide the sources. The implicit assumption is that these parties will inform the organization about all relevant known vulnerabilities. Some indicated that they assumed the national CERT would notify them about a vulnerability if it was really important, even though the national CERT itself explicitly states that its advisories are not meant to replace independent acquisition of vulnerability information.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark28" class="a">Relying on others to learn about about all relevant soft- ware vulnerabilities is a strong assumption – and potentially fatal. It helps us to understand why organizations often miss known vulnerabilities. After a breach, it might look negligent or incompetent not to have triaged a vulnerability that was known for months, but yet, in the context of these coping strategies, it is obvious that some vulnerabilities will fall through the cracks, simply because the capacity is lacking for comprehensive triage. In essence, these orga- nizations trust that what comes out of their sources’ funnel of information reduction are indeed the most relevant and urgent vulnerabilities for them. The basis for this trust is not really clear, but, as we argued in Section </a>8, it is a rational strategy to follow. None of the interviewees recalled their organizations experiencing an incident associated with vulnerability information that they had missed (although some speculated that one might have occurred in the past). There is no feedback loop that suggests that their trust in, say, the national CERT advisories, was not warranted.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark64" class="a">One example of relying on others is to use threat intel- ligence providers as a source of vulnerability information. While threat intelligence covers only a fraction of all vulner- abilities, it informs organizations about vulnerabilities that are actively being exploited. Given that most vulnerabilities are never exploited in the wild </a><a href="#bookmark65" class="a">[31, </a>32], it makes sense to focus scarce resources on those cases. In the U.S., this practice is now formally codified. The U.S. Cybersecurity &amp;</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark70" class="a">Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) publishes a Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog </a><a href="#bookmark71" class="a">[37] and it issued a Bind- ing Operational Directive </a>[38] that requires all federal civil- ian agencies to patch within two weeks all vulnerabilities added to this catalog. CISA also encourages all private organizations and local governments to do so.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">Still, the amount of trust placed, implicitly or explicitly, in the entities that provide vulnerability information raises questions about responsibility and accountability. Who is held accountable when organizations only learn about a vulnerability after an incident? Do their providers of vul- nerability information have any responsibility? For example: can breached organizations blame CISA for not including the exploited vulnerability in their catalog, even though it was clearly attacked in the wild? Does the national CERT share some of the responsibility by sending out more than a thousand advisories every year? Do commercial providers of scanning services face any liability for not including a vulnerability or not adequately detecting it? Or does all responsibility fall on the organization itself? As long as organizations do not experience security breaches because of missed vulnerability information, the answers to these questions remain mostly theoretical.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">Also, we have to recognize that it is already hard enough to act on the limited vulnerability information that the organizations currently acquire. It is one thing to learn about a software vulnerability, getting that vulnerability patched is something else altogether. It requires overcoming orga- nizational inertia, often because of the business continuity impacts of patching. Respondents mentioned that one reason they heavily rely on the advisories of the national CERT, is that these advisories carry the authority needed to convince their own organizations to initiate a patching process. Their management assigns more priority to these security advi- sories than to other sources of vulnerability information. In those circumstances, it might not make sense to acquire more information about known vulnerabilities, if it is already hard enough to remediate the ones you do know about.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li data-list-text="9.2."><h3 style="padding-left: 28pt;text-indent: -22pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark31">&zwnj;</a>Recommendations</h3><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark66" class="a">So what recommendations can we draw from these findings? First of all, our findings call into question the conventional security advice that organizations should try to acquire comprehensive vulnerability information for their assets, in order not to miss any known vulnerabilities </a><a href="#bookmark67" class="a">[33, </a>34]. The organizations we studied do not follow this ad- vice but are not suffering negative consequences for their coping strategies. Of course, one could argue that the lack of experienced breaches only means they have been lucky or perhaps even ignorant, if they were breached but did discover it. We cannot rule this out. There is always the possibility of low probability/high consequence events, i.e., ‘black swans’, meaning that the strategies of our respondents are not immune to failure. That being said, it would be wrong to discount the learning experience of these organi- zations: their limited intake of vulnerability information has proved good enough, so far.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark72" class="a">Acquiring and processing more vulnerability informa- tion is not free. This is clearly shown by the association we find between organizational capacity and the magnitude of vulnerability information being consumed. So these or- ganizations face a trade-off: should they divert resources away from elsewhere, perhaps from the patching process itself, to take in more vulnerability information? How would they know that this would imply a net gain in terms of security? We would argue that we cannot know that. The lack of incidents suggest there is little evidence that more information will increase security and the diverted resources might reduce security efforts elsewhere. In short, the conventional wisdom that acquiring more comprehensive information is better, is not supported by the evidence. Our recommendation is to re-evaluate this advice and view the coping strategies we uncovered as rational (in the sense of bounded rationality </a>[39]) and as a legitimate strategy.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">Our second recommendation builds on the finding that these practices have, for the most part, grown organically. It is rarely the outcome of an explicit evaluation process. Organizations seemed mostly unaware of how much infor- mation they are missing. They left the evaluation of their information intake as an afterthought. This may be because better curation is always important, but never urgent. We propose that organizations periodically review their intake of vulnerability information, for example on a yearly basis, or whenever service renewal comes up. Smaller organiza- tions can suffice with an informal discussion among team members. Larger organizations should consider formalizing this discussion with suitable metrics and measurements – because as the attack surface grows, so does the likelihood of experiencing an incident due to incomplete vulnerability information. We suggest asking the following questions:</p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">i) <span class="p">Which sources of vulnerability information cover which of our assets? </span>ii) <span class="p">Do we have assets that are currently not tracked by any source? </span>iii) <span class="p">Can we trust the prioritization done by our sources? </span>iv) <span class="p">Are our sources timely and do they contain actionable mitigation information?</span></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">Finally, we suggest to pay attention to vulnerability information in post-mortem of security incidents in which software vulnerabilities were exploited. Three respondents reported that they assumed their organization must have had incidents associated with missing information, even though they could not remember an actual example. Incidents pro- vide an important signal to evaluate and improve sourcing of vulnerability information, in terms of checking whether the organization had received and processed information related to the exploited vulnerability. Going forward, a more formal- ized foundation is to include the vulnerability information sources in the risk analysis process. This would then also allow coping strategies such as those that we identified to be explicitly chosen, rather than an implicit outcome.</p></li></ol></li><li data-list-text="10."><h2 style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 27pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark32">&zwnj;</a>Limitations</h2><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">The design of our study implies four key limitations. First of all, the sample of respondents and their organizations was recruited within one country (the Netherlands) and</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">via its national CERT. All participants came from critical infrastructures and government services. While the patterns that we found fit well within prior work conducted in other contexts, we have to be careful in generalizing these findings to other organizations and other countries.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">Second, we interviewed only one respondent per orga- nization. These interviewees had first-hand knowledge of the practices we wanted to observe, since they are the actual recipients of security advisories and other sources of vulnerability information. That said, their knowledge about the practices in other parts of the organization is likely to be incomplete. It seems unlikely that wholly separate vulner- ability triage processes are going on that they are unaware of, it is possible that elsewhere in the organization people also acquire some vulnerability information, especially in the larger organizations.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">Third, we tried to quantify the volume of vulnerability information that organizations ingest, but these sources are highly variable across time and providers. Also, respondents might not accurately remember the actual volumes of certain flows. Our attempts at quantification are meant primarily as a way to qualitatively compare the sources, not to pin them down to actual numbers. We have a reasonable idea of the order of magnitude of the total pool of discovered vulnerabilities, based on sources like VulnDB. We ranked the other sources in terms of their order of magnitude compared to that initial set and to each other.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">Last, since we recruited participants via the national CERT, it is possible that their answers reflect a social desir- ability bias towards questions on the CERT advisories. We tried to counter potential bias by asking indirect questions and rephrasing questions to cover all forms of vulnerability information.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p></li><li data-list-text="11."><h2 style="padding-left: 27pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark33">&zwnj;</a>Conclusion</h2></li></ol><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">A range of catastrophic breaches all share as their root cause an unpatched, but known, vulnerability. We identified coping strategies that organizations use to acquire, but also reduce, the intake of software vulnerability information. The lack of comprehensive acquisition of knowledge about published vulnerabilities is a disconcerting finding. Yet, it can also be understood from the resource constraints that organizations face. These organizations could not remember suffering any incident associated with missed vulnerability information. While there is no guarantee that there was no undiscovered breach or that no breach will occur in the future, the organizations’ experience suggest that it might be rational to be very selective in the intake of information, contrary to accepted best practices. Increasing that intake has no visible security benefits to them, as most vulnera- bilities are never attacked and therefore no breaches would necessarily be prevented, while it does require resources that might be more effective elsewhere. We do recommend that organizations conduct more deliberate evaluations of their vulnerability information acquisition, assessing the often im- plicit trade-offs in a more formal risk management process.</p><h2 style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Acknowledgments</h2><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 15pt;text-align: justify;">The authors are grateful to Matthijs Krijgsman for his help with coding the many interviews.
